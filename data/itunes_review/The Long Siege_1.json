If you miss, and wouldn’t match anything on the bounce-back, the line of tiles will not go back to its original position, but go one, or even two, spots backwards. While I understand this might be a desirable game mechanic from the designer’s point of view, the matching function is very picky AT TIMES. I haven’t figured out what makes it REALLY picky about the final position. You need to be almost EXACTLY on the match, or it will punish you. Of course, the times I notice are when it really counts. I’ve only played a couple hours, and this mechanic has already cost me a dozen losses. It’s... frustrating, which is not something a game should strive for.",

It offered enough incentive to try a level over if you failed and it didn't punish you for failure.\n\nThe music was surprisingly jaunty. A very positive melody throughout the levels kept the matching fun since you felt like you were able to match with the music and it was fun seeing the characters popping up on screen in time to the lovely violin!\n\n3 basic classes; healer, archer, and melee is the basis around the game. Matching 3 like tiles gives you a character of that set. Matching 4 gave you a giant version which added a fun little twist to combat. Upgrading the characters was definitely a bonus because failing a level still netted you rewards to upgrade your characters. The only downside is once you obviously max the characters out, the collected gold is useless.\n\nYou're able to upgrade your tower and cannon as well to match the difficulty of the enemies you fight against so it was also rewarding collecting coins for that. Enemies were your standard baddies that came in normal and large forms. After defeating them (they continually spawn) you destroy the tower and proceed. At the end of every level there is a giant boss fight which is a nice reprieve from the normal defending your tower against waves of enemies.\n\nAs you are progressing through the levels, you'll be given \"quests\" that insist of doing very specific in-game actions such as \"defeating X amount\" of enemies or \"matching X amount of large allies\" and it was fun trying to complete quests since it offered large amounts of coin to upgrade your characters and tower.\n\nAfter beating the game I am very satisfied. There was enough challenge to keep me going and the cute animations, coupled with the fun music kept me entertained. I'm only disappointed there was no new game plus offer. Instead, the game has you start all over after completing it. All-in-all, a rewarding game with enough length, challenge, and incentive to warrant a look at!",
