This game beats all other on the App Store in creativeness, graphics, immersion, and gameplay. I really enjoyed how the currency was a bit hard to come by and needed to be spent wisely. Absolutely worth the money and I sincerely hope there will be more levels added on or a sequel in the future?? All in all an AWESOME game",

You can feel how much fun the developers had when they were making the game because of the way they designed each levels with all the hidden gems and interactive objects (cor just chopping down trees for fun). The weapons are super fun in the game and all you have to do is to smash your buttons and destroy the enemies. \n\nThis game is not super difficult as long as you watch your health from time to time. There is also healing station on every level. You can make the game more difficult by baiting all enemies to you at once. It’s not a cheap game at 8.99 but personally I find it very enjoyable.",

Between the fact that everything is super small, and the rough controls, it is just way too easy to die and lose a big chunk of loot. \n\nDecent start but needs work.

But so far I’ve been able to beat everything, mostly I just have to go back to old levels and get more soldiers or earn enough money to buy more stuff. Every level has new enemies that you have to choose a new strategy for. You also get tons of abilities and weapons. So far I’ve played about five hours in, and I can contradict some people’s reviews. The guy who said the thumb holds are tiny must have massive thumbs because the hand holds are made more for an adult man than a little girl. Someone said that it costs too much when you die, yes it’s annoying but he only takes 1/3 of your money, which is easy to recover from. To recover health it does cost money, but it’s cheap. Overall I rate Barbearian 5 stars. It was worth $9.",

Many YouTube videos I have watched on this game, have players going straight into the horde of enemies/bosses and die. This is a result of not being aware of how the mini-bosses attacks or not managing their health. If you think the non-boss enemies don’t do much and the beginning is getting boring because it seems easy, KEEP PLAYING the game. Eventually it did get harder and I had fun learning how to beat these tough levels. The “end of chapter” bosses may seem hard at first, but once you learn how to approach the boss, it will be easier. There ARE Easter eggs that WILL get you to complete 100% of the game, so try exploring everywhere!!!\n\nPS: I was wondering if I could upload gameplay, I didn’t see anything, but I’m just making sure. Thanks!",
