Then there’s the docking process where you have to walk forever to meet with the next contact. Why make it so far away for no reason? I’m not even going to finish the game.

I can’t say it’s a great game because it eventually gets slow and repetitive. It’s fun enough to play when you’re bored. Strategy is really important and can definitely help you beat a level easily with low to no damage. Certain guns cannot be used by a specific player, which is ok after realizing that you don’t have to play as the captain, you can play as the other robots too! I do like that! One thing I don’t like is the fact that you have to buy storage boxes (with the water you earn, being that water is valuable because the characters are steambots) and you can’t keep things you want because with each level, the rewards or guns to buy are upgraded. Which is cool but if you have multiple steambots, you need more guns for them to use too.. there’s a lot I can say that needs to be fixed, but it’s not a necessity per say.. \n\nHowever! \n\nThe one thing that almost made me delete the game, was that you CAN replay the game with all your steambots (or start fresh again from scratch).. BUT, you DON’T get all the stuff you earned and bought throughout the first playing of the game!!!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬 No guns bought or earned, no water earned, no storage boxes bought or earned, NOT EVEN the player upgrades (leveled ups per player) that you earn throughout the game!!!!!! So you whether you choose to start brand new again at a higher level of difficulty or you choose to play the game with your steambots and a higher level or the same level of difficulty, YOU DO NOT get anything you worked hard to get.. you only get your crew, and nothing else. No upgrades, guns, nothing... \n\nYeah I like the game, but come on!!!! That’s annoying lol It really was fun to play, but can I have all my stuff back?!? Guess not haha",

It satisfies the nostalgia for my 90’s RPGs but is modern enough to keep me entertained. The pace is quick and the battles truly feel tactical (I’ve had devastating losses because of poor aim). Sometimes the robots arms waving slightly as you aim is a bit of an annoyance, but it keeps me paying attention to each shot. Overall the game is excellent, I’m just sad I may already be near the end of it. I hope they add an expansion or some kind of award tracking system to incentivize playing the game on the higher difficulties so I have a reason to keep coming back.",

I spent seven hours to finish the game, nonstop.\nIt reminds me Jagged Alliance a lot. They are all great turn based tactical games. But compare to JA, Steamworld Heist’s system is much less sophisticated. For one thing the dev chose side view, it makes the game completely 2 dimensional. And since units can not stay at ladders, the game space is shrunken too much. But JA uses 30 degree view, and units can go up to roofs, that makes JA 3 dimensional. So strategy part is much wider.\nJA also uses a well designed motion point system. In this system, shooting costs motion points just like walking and other actions. Spending more points makes aiming more accurate. This is greatest system I’ve ever seen. But STeamworld Heist uses an oversimplified system, which makes the strategy much less variable.\nI don’t know if there are certain reasons why iOS games could not reach the same height of PC games. I just don’t want to give any iOS game 5 stars. They are not worth it yet.",

The tone of the game is somewhat whimsical like any good RPG, but has an understated comical flavor all of its own. \n\nI'm a sucker for good turn-based strategy, especially when it comes to apps, since you're rarely free from distractions when stealing away to play on your phone a moment. The difficulty level was so well balanced that I never had to grind, yet always felt challenged. When failure happened, I was torn about whether to replay the mission or run a couple easier ones and come back with better guns. On all occasions but one, I was able to refine my strategy and succeed, which was an incredibly rewarding experience.\n\nDifferent members of your team get different weapons and skills. Realizing their strengths and weaknesses is key to identifying the niche they fill and creating a cohesive team.\n\nIf you're hesitating to risk the money, ask yourself if you want to waste your time playing another IAP shitshow, or do you want to enjoy your free time?",

Mainly because the games these days are such lower quality than the early 2000s. Now days it's common to pay $40 for a game that is only entertaining for a couple days. Where-as console games back in the day like Nintendo 64, GameCube, ps2 would last for months, sometimes years. Anyway, it wasn't until I lost the use of my left hand due to cancer that I needed to find one handed games. And when this went on sale I just got desperate for a game so I bought it & surprisingly, if I knew how much fun this game was I would have gladly paid full price a long time ago for it. I've been playing for days and it keeps getting better. Now I'm just hoping it lasts a long time because I dont want it to end. But yea, if you are debating to get it based on price, it's totally worth it. High quality, no bugs, really fun.",
