I played through the whole thing in a couple weeks. I have not completed *all* the extras, but have done many of them.\n\nThe story is fun. The graphics are beautiful. The writers depart from expected outcomes in several major ways and I was surprised by that at times. Not bad at all. \n\nThe items you get are fun to work with and while being familiar (aka: if you ever played Legend of Zelda), have a uniqueness of their own. \n\nA few annoying things: you get all this treasure/coins while playing the game and finding treasure chests, great. The issue is, there is little/nothing that is interesting to do with said money. You can basically only buy ammo and hearts and the occasional upgrade shard. I found that very boring. This being given, there were many times I went through extra time and trouble to access and open a treasure chest, expecting something great, only to be disappointed by ...more coins. I wish that there were more cool items or weapons or whatever as rewards over a bunch of relatively useless coins. Even having different armor or outfits for the hero would have been nice.\n\nControls-wise, I found it a constant nuisance when trying to break/strike a pot, my character regularly picked it up instead. Seemed like it would have been better to make that action a separate button. Also, I noticed many times having trouble, particularly while flying or in the boat, turning the screen view. Seemed like a glitch.\n\nAgain, overall, great game. Thanks for making it!",

Kudos to the developers and Apple Arcade for releasing such a beautiful game with outstanding graphics, dialogue, and story! Please please please continue to release  more games like Oceanhorn 2. This is definitely better than I expected!",

The gameplay isn’t bad, but it’s a bit too basic.  I think the most disappointing part of the gameplay is finding the hidden sparkles across the map, only to find out it’s just a coin.  The currency in the game doesn’t seem to have much of a purpose.  It would be great to use it to purchase upgrades.  Instead, it’s used to buy health and ammunition, which is found regularly by just slashing bushes and enemies.   The currency really needs to be tied to something a bit more satisfying.",

This isn’t a fault of Oceanhorn 2, nor the dev team. I simply cannot recommend playing this game without at least a controller, and ideally a larger screen. In the interest of full disclosure, I admit to only trying this game via Apple Arcade before committing to a purchase on the Nintendo Switch, which seems a much more ideal platform. \n\nAside from being a console game shoved into mobile devices, Oceanhorn 2 pays just Ike any other Zelda clone. I felt right at home with the familiar adventure, combat, puzzle solving, and dungeon diving mechanics, which was refreshing being one of three people who doesn’t like BOTW.\n\nTLDR; if you’ve ever wanted to play classic 3D Zelda on your mobile device, then definitely buy this for Switch.",

I love this game but it made me so made that the city, world, was left in runes and the heroes just run away. Please tell me there is another game. Oceanhorn 3 perhaps? To be honest it made me mad. Such a good story can’t just end with that. Originally before the ending I would have given this a 100 star, but…. Tell me there is an Oceanhorn 3 please. Thank you.",
