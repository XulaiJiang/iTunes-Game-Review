When I get cut or scratched I bleed kairo blood!\n\nEdit: that'd be so cool you could see the inside of the rival mall :3 i wonder what the dying rival mall looks like inside >;3\n\nEdit2: so in my third multi-million game (i cant tell you how many times i played without getting to a million, then one day I reahed new heights) i initially planned for my mall to fail...until i was doing even better than i could ever imagine! Unlocking even MORE shops!!! MU-WAHAHAHA $210 MILLION by the 17 year and the 10 month! Muwahaha! My 5 rivals so far didn't stand a chance! Every single one of them beaten down to the ground and crushed before their first year in business is up! I am a monster! Aahhh the number of retail jobs i must've destroyed! ;) their profits going down by $2,000,000 each month!!! They can't win! Meanwhile, making up to $5 million a month! And on average $3-4 million a month! This game is so addicting!\n\nRivals\nFun land: Crushed in Less than 5 months\nBargain house: Dead in less than 8 months\nMach Land: Blighted in less than 4 months\nMach Station: Forgotten in less than 1 year\nCrazy Station: Demolished! Demolished i tellz yah! In approximately 1 year\n\nAlthough i'm sure there are people out there making 12 million a month, so I'm really trying not to brag...probably failing at it miserably, as there is always someone more skilled. So i dont think I'm the best, I guarantee you I'm not the best. But i am pretty good >;P\n\nHeres one hint: if you want to kill off your rivals and show no mercy, invest in the neighborhoods they have the highest share in, upgrade services and quality. But this is easily figured out so im sure you got this mang >:P\nThe best part about these games is the music. I notice the music in every game is very simple. Genius. And for a company of only NINE employees I must say it only exposes their genius even more. Mega Mall Story is possibly one of the best ever. I also love the creativity of kairosoft games. From the types of services you can provide in each shop to the types of plans you can use in the nippon cafe game. And the customers you can get. XD Mean seriously! (SPOILER ALERT) A flying saucer?! XD I friggin LOVE IT! I cant go into a mall now without the music in my head xP. This game is more than worth the money!! Buy it now. Or i will run your local mall out of town as well >;) and you will have no choice but to visit my museum, and my exhibit area.",

                    "label": "After just finishing my first (and most likely only) playthrough of the game, i figured i had enough expirence with it that my opinion might either convince people to get it or leave it alone.\n\nContexts:\n1. Gameplay.\n2. How to play.\n3. Why you should get this game.\n4. Reasons to not get the game.\n5. Small nit-picks.\n6. Sunmary.\n\nGameplay:\nWhile the gameplay is pretty simplistic, to create a really good mall that you will be proud in takes a little more thought than your average casual Iphone game, though not as much as any worth-your-time stratagy or card Iphone game. And because of that, it's my opinion that the thing that is the best thing about this game is the roleplaying. If the prospect of starting out from pretty much scratch, turning it into a fifthteen story super-mall, all while investing in cities and parks, fighting off other competing malls, and more, intrests you, than you will probably like this game. You can even get pigs, alians, ducks, ninjas, and other strange customers. But if you want something that requires a lot of stratagy, and a quick app you can open and test your mind, this is definetly not the app for you. In this app the majority of thought goes into where to place your stores ahead of time. But even if you mess that up, you can move pretty much all of your stores around for a measly 5k (not all that much in this game).\n\nHow to play:\nI played this game through four long nights of playing this on my phone, lying on my couch, thrusting upward to the beat of music I was singing too. And I believe that is one of the best ways to enjoy this game. If you have long periods where you sit around doing nothing, this is a great game to fill that with. Maybe if you have your computer is sitting around rendering video, if you're over at a friends sleep over and everyone else has fallen asleep. If you're at school in classes which are easier than this game. That is how this game is meant to be enjoied. If you plan on finishing this game in short intervals spread over a long period of time, I would bet you will get bored of it really fast. This game is a time sink. A good time sink, but a time sink. I enjoied it because it put me in a mood i enjoied, more than because the game was in any way immersing.\n\nWhy you should get this game:\n1. This game is not a time based game, even though it plays like it. You wont have to wait around hours everyday to be able to do things. If you have played games like Tiny Tower or Pocket Planes, you know exsactly what I mean. Even though this game gives you the satisfaction of sinking so much time into a game you can do whatever you want in it, you don't have to wait to put time into it.\n2. There are no IAP. This I am very pleased with Kairosoft for. When most other games are plagued by pop ups, adds, or IAP, to make an extra buck off of players, Kairosoft does none of these. Even though this contributed little to the actual game, I thought it was worth it pointing out.\n3. It's cheep. I got a good 10+ hours of not bad entertainment, for a really good price.\n\nReasons to not get this game:\n1 It's repetitive. Both in gameplay, and out of gameplay. At times I felt myself falling asleep and setting the game to give me a noise when I got the next game-pausing pop-up, because I knew missing the few store level-ups wouldn't hurt me too badly at the stage I was in.\n1a. You probably wont play through the game more than twice. The replayability in this game is practically zero. Even though the game had a New Game + mode that activates automatically when you start anouther playthrough after beating it once. This mode lets you keep all of your stores (but not your special stores) and combos. That is actually a pretty big deal, but is it enough to warrent anouther 10 + hour game? Even in Pocket Academy you had other schools to play after you finished the first... If it is however, enough to warrent it you will find serious trouble playing it a third time. I might play a second one myself, but I will probably just buy anouther Kairosoft game instead.\n2. The last three hours were a bore compared to the rest of the game. It feels drawn out in a bug way. The first seven hours I was working on getting more regulars, and investing in parks, and buying combos, and moving around stores. The last thee house though, I had all the combos, I had all of the investments finished, I had my entire mall organized to the last squre. It felt like a Where's Waldo, where the objective was to find the store that flashes Level Up. There is no hurrying to buy the last combos, there are no close competition malls if you have your fountains and other one square rep. Boosters placed correctly (which is all in one corner in a combo behind elavators, if you were wondering). The only reason I even stuck with this portion of the game was because I wanted to say that I beat it after putting seven hours into it already. The game would have benifited greatly from a hurried ending where you couldn't have all the stuff on time, or even some choices that affected gameplay im some way.\n\nSmall nit-picks:\n1. It would be nice if I had known the extent of size my mall would grow to when I started. This doesn't really affect how much time I spent, and Kairosoft actually has really good reasons to keep that mechanic in the game.\n2. It's almost impossable to play without having the controls up, which take up about a third of the screen.\n\nSummary:\nI would give this game an 8/10. It's a nice charming game that knows what it wants to be. It leaves you somewhat unsatisfied at the end, and will not want you comming back, but for a cheep game that comes with 10+ hours of roleplay driven gameplay, I would recommend it.",

People saying they are having trouble with the \"rival malls\" are just not saving and spending money wisely. I had everything thing unlocked including investments, buildings, etc and with a total of 42 million dollars by the end of the game and i never had gone under my budget. As long as you don't get a buy a stores at the beginning of the game like crazy you will be fine.\n\nIn conclusion, i would highly recommend this app if you played their other games and know what to expect. I wouldn't want to start their games with this one. I have a feeling people might get bored and quit.",

If you're on the fence and not sure if its worth the cash then here's my thoughts.\n\n There seem to be two different types of Kairosoft games.  City builder type and Dev story type.  Both I love, but the latter is def my pref.  This game would be the latter also.\n\nIt's cute and charming.  Watching those little people running around buying 16 lattes and then 12 salmon steaks just never gets old.  \n\nIt's all about leveling up your stores and making combos which anyone familiar with these titles already understands.  It's got a decent replay value due to NewGame+ \nThere have been a couple duds, even though still kinda fun, that don't compare to previous titles.  MegaMall is far from it.",
