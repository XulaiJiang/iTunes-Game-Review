It takes a little patience but it is rewarded by a sense of accomplishment when one completes the game. Yes, it is a time waster. It is also a lot of fun.\n\nI have now completed the game twice. That second time the difficulty level is increased. This made it more challenging. I do not know how many difficulty levels there are. I enjoyed it even more the second time. Good replay value!",

I can usually get 2-3 down (despite healing back to full in less than 2 seconds) before the monsters stop taking damage, their health bars just sitting in place, and I get to watch the screen slowly scroll to the left to defeat. \n\nEveryone who says they love it probably has not played that far are has been incredibly lucky.\nEvery time I completed a hard objective that was blocking progress it was due to pure luck.\n\nReplay 10000000, the previous game is better in every way.",

So yeah. It's a personal problem for me, obviously a lot of people love this game. So if you are really into fast paced candy crush-type games like this, get it.

You get random tiles as you progress through a dungeon and just have to hope and pray that you get the right tiles to match whatever you might have to work on that that point. Most of the time I can't even make it through the first phase of a dungeon because I don't have the tiles to defeat an enemy before the time runs out then they make you move so fast to make that you really can't make out a strategy and instead are just aimlessly matching and trying to pay attention to the obstacle you have. \n\nThen there are dark levels where you can't even decipher what the obstacle is and they still want you to be fast and match the right tiles for the task. As it turns out the game is more of you just repeating a stage over and over and over and over until you finally complete an objective but it's really not that fun and really not work the money I paid for it. No one wants to pay 3 bucks for a game that doesn't even offer any real game play. Don't waste your time or money on this game because in the end you will be disappointed that you paid 3 dollars for a game that you don't even have to think about to play. There are plenty of free games out there that you don't have to put much thought into that would be much more worth your time. TRASH!!",
