It has an amazing learning curve that anyone with over a Triferatu under their belt will know. Getting a Volleo might've been my greatest gaming achievement, and this is coming from a big console game.\n\nI've been playing this game since its release in 2014, and I haven't stopped since.

Every once in a while Threejay gives some excellent affirmation from Joe Esposito’s classic song featured in Karate Kid — “You’re the best around!” The giggles induced by that interjection inspire enough for this wandering wordy review. \n\nThanks, Sirvo! \n\nPS: Using Night Colors is the best way to play :)",

So few other games accomplish that.\n\nI love the design and level of detail that has been poured into this game. I've owned it since it was released in 2014 and it's stood the test of time, needing very few updates in order to stay compatible with iOS.\n\nAccording to the stats, I have played this game over 20,000 times.
