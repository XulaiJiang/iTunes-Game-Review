The menu comes up to leave the level and adjust volume levels. Dismiss the menu and the game treats it as if you’ve instructed it to skip your turn. Jerks move and your plotted path is both gone and screwed up.\n\nUPDATE responding to the developer: this has only been experienced on my phone with finger taps. Found a workaround to just force quit the app without dismissing the menu. Then when returning, the tuen hasn’t been skipped. Yes, i have to plot it again, but at least it doesn’t mess me up completely. I have no way to reliably reproduce the bug and it’s unpredictable. Saw on Reddit that others have experienced this.",

Not sure it is the fault of the game developer, but I’m quitting this game for now with my sincere best wishes to the developers of this otherwise fantastic game.\n\nUpdate 2: I figured out the GameCenter problem: separate IDs for store and iCloud. I signed out of GameCenter on my phone (store account) and was automatically signed in with iCloud, with the expected profile. Downloaded Grindstone again and it moved smoothly into my saved games with zero issues. Glad to have resolved this so I can inflame my RSI again wearing out the screen on my iPhone!",

Additionally, the player character does not level up in any way through the game. You only gain access to “gotcha” style weapons and defenses that have limited usefulness, and no space to be equipped anyway.\n\nMechanics were clearly designed for a cash machine game, which somehow ended up in Apple Arcade.

I used to play Simon’s Cat Crunch on the daily, but this one feels like SCC...on steroids. I so appreciate the ability to “drop loot and run” at any point on a game board, as well as the ability to pick up in the middle of a board after re-opening the app. This was developed so thoughtfully and I really appreciate it. I sometimes let my 5-year-old “help” me play and it actually makes him laugh out loud. We both yell “GUTS!” when we smash a Jerk. I just saw that Nintendo Switch will be getting Grindstone this Fall—we’ll definitely be buying the game!! GET GRINDING, Y’ALL!! PS: To developers: there is an occasional bug with the Jerks who throw arrows—sometimes if you open a board that features them, they’ll be shaking/vibrating super fast and it’s hard to tell when they’re highlighted red ie about to throw an arrow.",

Grindstone is dressed up as an Apple Arcade game, but it reeks of a more nefarious money grabber like the others. Here is a summary: 1) great concept with good presentation. 2) progressively harder - by world 2, it already becomes either beyond challenging or pure luck to beat levels (I’m a completionist and go for the crown in every level, which for all intents and purposes is impossible). 3) eventual frustration and deletion. Good for a couple hours. A slog after that. The Achilles heel of all of these games is the random drop engine. These can dictate whether you luck into a 12 move combo or get stuck with only 1 color in each direction. As you move on, the boards become more ridiculous blocked with boulders and crates that can’t be wrecked because there is no way to get combos long enough. Ultimately, this was designed to make money by getting players to buy lives and pay-to-win with charms and stones, but ended up in the Apple Arcade, which is exactly the kind of garbage I hoped to avoid with my subscription. Oh and a bit of constructive feedback: it would be nice if you didn’t have to go to the tavern after every round to refill your lives. It’s a lot of clicking and time wasting for no reason.",
