                    "label": "So far I really like this game. Best part is none of the crap free games do with trying to get you to put up $10, $25, $50!!!! just to be able to advance at a reasonable pace. Try it out for a little while for free then decide if you want to pay which you will of course and they know it because it’s awesome!!!!!\n\nAs far as the game goes good story line so far. Makes you really want to keep playing to find out what happened and how many more people are out there. Game play is pretty easy you don’t have to worry about getting killed constantly unlike games like last day on earth which I liked for a while until it became impossible to get to where you needed to go without spending money and or buying weapons. This game you can play as long as you want with none of that waiting 20 min for a charge to appear. So many games could be great if they would just offer a paid ver.\n\nOther aspects I like. This may seem odd but the sound track is really cool. It reminds me exactly of the firefly tv show. Still one of the greatest shows ever made! The way each land area forms as you go is pretty neat graphically and the of course the narration of the story is perfect. Lots of funny little jokes added in if you decide to stupidly run off the side and die or go hack and slash on the fence posts.\n\nDefinitely worth a try.",

There is an assortment of weapons to use as well as customizations to them to further suit your gameplay style. The world is beautiful and engaging as it literally builds around you. \n\nBUT\n\nIn my opinion, what makes this game so engaging is the very well voiced narration as it guides you through the game and story. Even more engrossing is the music by Darren Korb. I can not say enough to this man’s contribution to video game music. There are a few songs in game with sung lyrics by both Korb and vocalist Ashley Barrett. While Barrett’s voice is hauntingly beautiful in Bastion, I also want to strongly recommend you check out Supergiant’s game “Transistor” where she shines through the game’s soundtrack, amazingly written and produced by Korb. \n\nHonestly, any game by Supergiant Games is a literal journey into a fantastical world and has none have ever disappointed me. If Bastion is your first experience by this developer, you’re in for a wild ride!",

                    "label": "No microtransactions or internet connection requirements, this game makes every effort to be a faithful replica of the PC version, with a few changes to be mobile-friendly. \n\nThe controls are slightly dumbed down - in a good way. There’s the classic control scheme which offers a gamepad (console-style) UI. The other option is a smart control scheme truly designed for mobile from the ground-up: Click to move, auto-aim and attack, and a few other buttons. I like how the smart control scheme largely prevents falling through holes in the ground which can be extremely common. \n\nThe gamepad (classic) UI made the smart decision of having auto-targeting instead of twin-stick gameplay which would be downright cumbersome. \n\nMy only gripe with the simplified UI is that it doesn’t show ammo meters for ranged weapons, which means you could jump into combat and get a nasty surprise when your opening move is “reload”. Other than that - well done, extremely well done. \n\nDifficulty is generally lower than on PC - understandable due to control limitations. Falling through holes in the ground doesn’t damage you, enemies do lower damage, and health restores are more common, although you can’t stockpile health restores like on PC. In case you’re absolutely terrible at video games, there’s an “infinite lives” mode so you can cheat your way through and enjoy the story without any semblance of difficulty. \n\nThat’s just about all the differences. For those who are new to Bastion, it’s the first (and IMO) best ever game from Supergiant. It’s best thought of as a 2D action-adventure with innovative storyline, great music, and combat just complex enough for a PC game - which translates into something far above the mobile games industry.\n\nBear in mind that Bastion is not a loot ARPG, despite using similar combat style and visual presentation. Items and upgrades are not randomly generated with affixes (although you can find upgrades with fixed, predetermined stats). \n\nIn case you haven’t figured it out, Bastion easily gets 5 stars.",
