You have to stop touching the screen for a second to get it all to reset, and in any close battle, especially in the 3rd person player mode where you run around with a sword, it will cause you to die, A LOT. Such a shame! On top of that, the advertisements for expansions and boost packs randomly appear the top of the main sailing gameplay screen, larger than any other icons on the screen, no way to hide them I can find, and when tacked on next to the normal icons, they block the top left part of the screen pretty well, which is no good. Sell things when players log on or go to menus, NOT in the middle of gameplay.",

However, I just want to say the land mode in this game is in sharp contrast with the sea mode which is awesome. I think this is ok since the game features pirates and overseas trading. However, since it does involve activity inlands, I have a few comments on that:\n1. The graphics is not great but acceptable since this is after all a game on phone, so although I still point this out but I’m not complaining on that.\n2. Compared to its relatively boring graphics and storyline, land missions in this game are too difficult. It’s not fun at all failing over a last-century style/quality game. Maybe this whole DLC is still under-developing, but still, for its quality it’s too hard. For example, the Emperor’s daughter mission is too long to finish and your character too easily killed(It doesn’t make any sense that none of his crew would follow and help him ashore, just as in sea battles.) also you spend really too much time just killing irrelevant zombies and have to tighten up your nerves every time handling these supposedly trivial obstacles just because each of them can be insanely fatal. I mean why should I keep playing a series of boss fights before I even reach a minor step in the whole mission? All of these problems are aggravated by the fact that land missions are of low quality and too crude. \nThe main part of the game is awesome and really fun. But the land missions are just trash and I couldn’t believe I paid for it.",

As soon as you get to the settlement you’re instantly killed by guys sitting there with guns! If it wasn’t for the ship battles, I would’ve already deleted this game and left a one star review.

And I tried on both my iPad and my iPhone, no difference. So I had to go to their web sight and write them an email. And surprise surprise, haven’t heard from them for over a day and a half now. I tried reinstalling the game, resetting my devices. It’s something with my save, which is now probably corrupted. If they made it easy to contact them, I’d be fine with that, but they really don’t.
