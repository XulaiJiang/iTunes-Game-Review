One thing that needs refining is the hair of the avatars they need to be integrated better I find some hair pieces don’t look natural at all. But not a big deal (plus hair always looks strange on avatars) \n\nThis game is just so addictive it’s insane I will just play in forever all day every day it’s great. \n\nBut Are there plans to integrate more stuff into the game or will that be in MM4?\n\nI would love to see and Indy Car or Formula E In a future version of the game. And a multiplayer mode would be great too!!!\n\nThe NEW Endurance mode is well made but not my favorite it’s a lot more micro management, but I’ve only done 1 invitational in it so idk yet. The NEW elimination mode it awesome so much fun and a good change to the normal race style. The NEW mechanics are great everything about then so well implemented. \nI don’t really understand the NEW suppliers aspect besides the face that it gives you more bonuses.  The NEW influence system and NEW voting system is soooooooooo good it’s very good.  \n\nIn the end it’s a great game definitely worth the price and I would give it 5 stars but I don’t believe in a perfect game. But they came close.",

My only issue is how perfect the bots are, and at times they almost seem cheaty. I’ve seen countless times a computer go around the last 3 laps or so on  less than 10% Hyper Soft tires and that’s just not ok because I can’t make it one lap, event on conservative driving and 100% tire wear. I don’t think I’ve ever witnessed a car (other than my own) have to limp around a track because of a tire blowout, fuel shortage, or any other factor than a crash. And I experimented and it’s like this on all 3 difficulties. A multiplayer system could be a way to take my mind off that 🤷‍♂️",

And in the grand scheme of things, this game is really fun. The racing seems to be improved, and there’s definitely a learning/development curve whenever you change racing leagues. BUT there’s one feature that absolutely kills this game for me, the card-based qualifying. As someone who actually works in data acquisition for a racing team, this feels like a slap in the face after the rest of the Motorsport manager series. I really enjoyed getting feedback and making changes in the PC version, but nope we got AR. So while that’s never going to change can we at least get 2018 iPad Pro support?",

But I think something really cool would be a driver stats database so you can compare your drivers stats to retired drivers stats, and just for record keeping.  Things like wins, podiums, and DNFs would be kept in there and I think that would be so cool to compare, similar to football manager.  But overall great game!",

This game is beyond addicting, and if you’re smart enough, you won’t need to bother with the microtransaction. That being said: one of the biggest aspects that could be improved upon in an update or even MM4 would be the sponsorship system. Frankly there needs to be longer sponsorship contracts (like a complete season), or contracts that you can renew/negotiate, or make them worth more than they currently are. While I’m not the most learned in the minutiae of F1 or WEC, I don’t think teams’ contracts expire after X-races, and once those contracts expire, the company doesn’t wash their hands of the race team. So why can’t I renew with a company that I really like? Because of this, I haven’t figured “the sauce” with enduro-racing. Maybe it’s me, and having to sign six drivers with those tiny sponsorship deals, but I’ll keep playing to figure it out. One final addendum, would be driver testing. No race team would just sign a driver without seeing how they drive in their (the race team’s) car. Why expect the manager to plop down a stack of cash on a shot in the dark? TL;DR This game is well worth the price, don’t buy the microtransactions, and be smart with your in-game money.",

And last I think engine components would also add to the strategy but make them be able to be shut off for the people who do not like them. Engine components would also make the game more in depth with real life making three of every component would make you plan more about the races. Last but not least make the track grip go up so the times will get more competitive at the end of the session making for more close racing. That is all this game needs to be a great game",
