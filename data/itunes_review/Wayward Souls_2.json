                    "label": "This game would sell amazingly on Switch. Dead Cells is doing great right now and I feel this game is slightly better than Dead Cells. The gameplay loop feels very similar despite being top down vs side scrolling. It’s a day-one purchase for me if you bring it to Switch. $9.99 or $14.99 would be the best price point. Though as good as this game is, if you included some new content like one new area and a new class I think $19.99 would be doable as well. Seriously you guys this game is perfect for that platform. ****ACTUAL REVIEW**** What can I say? This game is seriously a masterpiece in game design. The procedural generation is some of the best you’ll ever play. The classes, weapons, and abilities are fun and unique. I really like how the progression works where if you beat a “level” and have opened a new level, you can go straight to the new unlocked level instead of doing the entire game over when you die. This keeps the rougelike tension going without punishing you too much when you die. The levels are fairly long so you still feel the roguelike sting when you die, as you have to replay the entire area. Combat is satisfying, as are the different abilities and weapons to experiment with. There is a dash that includes a swing of your sword that I absolutely love. I prefer melee in general but the projectile weapons and magic are unbelievably fun to use. I truly think this is one of the most under appreciated and underrated games on the AppStore. Seriously great work devs, and for the love of God, PLEASE bring it to Switch so I can play this on the go with physical controls on this large screen. I want it SO bad!",

Controls can sometimes not respond like you want ‘em, or the monsters’ behavior spontaneously deviates from its usual pattern. You might find that you randomly get hit by a monster who only uses magic attacks even when your magic shield is up. It’s frustrating, but makes the game more challenging. \n\n2) The game doesn’t let you play your own audio. The music is amazing! Props to Joey Grady. But after hours of game play, sometimes you just wanna switch it up with your own soundtrack.\n\nNevertheless, this is an epic dungeon crawler with fun characters and a nostalgic retro vibe.

The story is strange and filled with little meanings- the combat is challenging and fairly rewarding. The level design reminds me of old school Gauntlet.

The entire game is astonishingly fun, and the diverse weapons and abilities plus the randomized upgrades are very entertaining since sometimes your upgrades aren’t what you’d like and you have to adjust to them. The bosses are well made, and the difficulty stacks up against even Dark Souls in my opinion. The third gold level is greatly difficult and I have yet to clear it, having only reached floor 7 of the Catacombs. But that doesn’t stop me due to the randomly generated floors which leads to a ton of fun. I’d give this 15 stars if I was able to.",

The story is awesome, the battles challenging but possible, and some music is just absolutely amazing, like the theme before the final boss and. This game is definitely worth $7.00 but i think its worth at least triple that. There is a variety of gameplay between the heroes and if you beat everything with every character, you could try to defeat the tutorial boss. This game also works on some older devices and was definitely worth the grab. Thanks for such an amazing game!",

I'm also wondering when the paladin update will come on.\nGreat game, five stars. Try out RocketCat's other games in the App Store, such as Death Road To Canada or PunchQuest.

I was really hoping for a sequel to MG, but was still excited when this came out. Turned out to be a let down, mainly because the lack of a story driven game. \n\nWayward reuses the enemies from MG. Same attack patterns; same design; same feel. There's a few new. \n\nStill have to grind to level up. You do this by grinding for coins to buy upgrades for the characters. Each of which must replay through the areas you've already beaten. Which is a bit annoying but makes sense in the regard that you have to beat the areas with each character to progress each characters story. \n\nEach new level (mines, tower, etc.)   resets your characters amor and weapons upgrades. So when to beat the mines expecting to continue on to the tower, you instead are kicked out to the start menu and are forced to start the next area with crap gear again. This includes pets. \n\nThe colors are dark making it hard to see outside. \n\nThe Mage character can't shoot diagonal but the enemies can. This is a big disappointment for me cause I like the mages/archer builds in game",

The gameplay is quite difficult but addicting; I get frustrated and leave for a while, sure, but I always come back to it. The music is beautifully eerie, too. I eagerly chase new pieces of story that emerge with each playthrough; even something as small as a conversation of two ghosts about one of the Saints statues gives you more info about the world, and I keep finding new tidbits despite having played the levels likely hundreds of times by now! I accidentally missed one by killing the speaker before they finished, and I still regret it. This game builds a true world, which you soon realize the story you're following is only a small part of. Amazing in every way- I could not give constructive criticism even if I tried. It's absolutely worth your money if you like beautiful music, interesting stories and world-building, and challenging but addicting dungeon crawlers (real-time ones, that is). Try this out- if you like these things, you won't regret it!",

All six of the characters are drastically different and playing each of them will tell you more of the story. I love the art style, the minimal presentation of the interesting stories, the ghostly NPCs acting out events from the past, and the quirky, occasional scripted encounters.\n\nThis game starts off simple enough, but it'll push you to master it (I've been playing since it was released and I still haven't beaten the third set of levels). If Dark Souls were made for mobile devices, I feel like it could gain a lot by being based on the engine used in Wayward Souls. I mention Dark Souls instead of Diablo because Dark Souls feels more visceral, more intense, and that is the same sort of gameplay that I get while playing Wayward Souls. Like Dark Souls, Wayward Souls does not hold your hand, nor does it forgive sloppy play. You can make mistakes, sure, but if you make too many they'll add up and you'll end up back at the character select screen, spending the gold you earned to do better next time. Failure isn't punished nearly as badly, and there's a real sense of accomplishment when you finally beat a boss for the first time with a given character. (Seriously. I texted my girlfriend when I finally beat the first boss with the Mage, not because the boss was hard but because the bats - an enemy that gave me no trouble as the Warrior - were incredibly hard for me to fight, and I kept entering the boss fight with almost no health).\n\nUnlike Dark Souls, though, and like Diablo, you will often have to fight several  enemies at once. The game gives you enough tools to make this manageable, though it's a constant challenge. Don't slip up.\n\nBut do buy, and play, this game.",
