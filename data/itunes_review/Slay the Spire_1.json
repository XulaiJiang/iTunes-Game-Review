The result is tiny text, unnecessary extra taps, and graphics that look great on larger screens but are a jumbled mess zoomed out.\nI really really wish they would go back and give this another shot but I worry they won’t. I won’t ask for a refund because I want to support the dev but do not purchase unless you have an iPad.\nAnd devs plz give this another shot I know you can produce something fantastic.",

You could easily spend years just playing the additional options.  I’m 50, my hands are a mite pudgier (I’m average not rail skinny now) and I can see some of the interface issues.  My only requests are:\n\n1. Let cards that are let go snap back so I can easily reselect any one.\n2. Put the card type (Attack, Skill, etc. in the tooltips). I almost have to squint on an iPhone X to see the card type, and also take my finger off too in the middle of play to see if one card affects others in my hand.\n3. Could there be confirmation if a seed is highlighted in green that it’ll be played again? It doesn’t look like a copied seed toggle.  I know it’s easy to write down and punch back in and it’s also easier when I use seeds based on nasty phrases about various people’s mothers, but you know.\n4. Can you fully disable particle effects on the lowest settings? They’re still everywhere (coins, corner animations) and eat a ton of battery.  To the game’s credit, it’s never caused a typical overheat.\n\nOtherwise A+++++++++++.  So many character classes are recycles of each other but I LOVE the Defect class.  Super original! Get this now if you are considering any kind of destructive behavior.  It will hook you like a monkey pressing a bar and instead fill your head with a dreamy haze of great animation surpassed by epic gameplay.\n\nUpdate: dear Lord is the Watcher a difficult class at Ascension Level 1.  I have played probably 60 times trying to clear it and just did yesterday.  Amazingly, I had great fun 58 of those times.",

My biggest complaint is that there should be an undo button; with the tiny phone interface it’s possible to make mistakes. Still, this will be on my phone for a long, long time.

Users naturally want to flick up and down to see multiple cards. This causes you to pick cards. Since picking the wrong card can actually ruin an entire run (hour+ investment) it’s a pretty big deal. Hmm? How do we solve this? It’s not rocket science, put in a undo button for card selection screens. Down the road redo the awful scroll. \n- I can’t read the bottom of the card text when it’s in my hand and since they move around it’s my natural tendency to want to move them up to keep reading. This can cause you to play the card.\nEventually you know your deck pretty well but it’s a minor nitpick. \n-upgraded option not visible on key screens. Too many trips to wiki when you could put some type of info button on card selection screens. \n\nDid I mention the game is amazing?

It has tremendous replayability as every time you play it will be different and you can play around a lot with how you play it. I have a few minor quibbles that would make it better. \n1. It is too easy to accidentally select the wrong card when choosing one to upgrade, I’ve been scrolling through and accidentally selected a different one than I wanted repeatedly. \n2. It is easy to accidentally play the wrong card as to read the full text you have to tap them to raise them up to full visibility. It’s very easy to accidentally play the card when doing so, although I suspect that it’s less of an issue playing it on a tablet rather than on the iPhone with the difference of screen sizes.\n3. The last issue is more of an ask than a bug. I would love it if the game had the functionality to allow you to listen to music, podcasts, or audiobooks while playing. While the music and the sound effects are well done, I like to listen to other things while playing games on my phone and whenever I load StS it automatically stops whatever I’m listening to in favor of the game’s soundtracks.\nOther than those issues, the game is super fun if you like deck builders and I recommend it without reservation, more than worth the cost.",

The port is less than optimal and I just wanted to throw my hat in talking about it so hopefully the devs can improve it in an update.  It’s too direct of a port from PC, the UI is, text, relics, etc is too small on phones.  Taking inspiration from the way Hearthstone handles it would be good here. Tap and hold on cards in hand should blow up the card on screen so the text can be read.  Tapping on the card as it works now is too clunky, because then another tap in the playing field plays the card, and I imagine this resulting in accidental plays.  The characters could be zoomed in on also.  Implementing the way HS handles your hand on mobile, where you tap to widen or shrink your hand would solve the cards blocking the characters the whole time if you zoom the camera in on the characters.  When you’re choosing a card reward, you need to be able to tap on one of the cards to blow it up and you should be able to see the upgraded version before making your choice.  There’s also a lot of screen real estate when choosing between the three cards, so I think they can be zoomed in on as well.  When selecting a card to play from your hand, it currently lets you drag it across the other cards in your hand, which I don’t think is necessary, you only need to be able to drag cards to characters in the field of play.  When you’re looking at relics, the tooltip covers a portion of the text saying what the relic does.  In the main view, tap and hold on the relics at the top of the screen should blow up the text saying what it does in the middle of the screen so you can read it, it’s too small currently.  \n\nTLDR:  It’s UI is too small and should be made bigger, the controls need to be tweaked but the core game is awesome and an instabuy.\n\nEdit:  The devs are working with the porting team to improve the mobile ux, so the game isn’t gonna be abandoned now that the port is done, which is great news!  I imagine the update would drop when the Android version is released.",

The interface isn’t perfect, so you might have to spend some time making sure you’re selecting the right card, but it’s totally workable. There’s also a setting that helps you to not accidentally click things if you think you might need it.\nAs for the game itself, it’s extremely fun with a bunch of different strategies and possibilities. $10 is totally worth it, must buy!",
