                    "label": "When I first downloaded this game on my very first iPad five years ago, my gaming life was changed forever. As soon as I got up in the morning, during the day, and before bed at night, I played this. I was young, but I got as far as the first Void space station. I had decent stuff, and a strategy that I used for Knights Of The Old Republic as well: Move around oddly and shoot randomly. I was young, so I didn’t even bother to strategize. My iPad broke a year later, and I got a new one two years later, on which I downloaded  this again, only to delete it because I was horrible at it. Now, on my new iPhone 8, I have downloaded it again, and in 1 day and 40 minutes (I got on today at 8:40 AM, it’s 9:20 AM right now) I’ve developed a mining strategy (Only get Hyperanium, Sodil, and Gold), improved my skills a ton, killed a pirate in a Dark Angel by using a Scram Cannon and Ex Charged Pulse Laser on the cheapest ship in the first Terran base (Starship), got a powerful shield and good armor, and currently have like 5 achievements. Overall, great game, best one out there for mobile, it has an amazing story and great graphics, and it’s the only good mobile game out there that doesn’t shoot ads at you like a machine gun and is not P2W or P2P! All the purchases are just DLC, you can win extreme mode without them, and I mean it! These devs should be proud of themselves. They have no ads, no P2W or P2P, and the game is completely original and well made. Please make Alliances , Manticore, and the other GOF games available on the App Store, and available for iPhone 8. Please make them free, too! Thanks for reading this, thanks for making the game, and keep up the good work.",

The graphics are top notch, the gameplay is pretty fantastic, and it just works as a casual game to pick up and fly to the next station to see if they’ve got the materials you need for your next blueprint. My only complaint is one that seems pretty common here: the IAP’s from the previous version don’t count on this one. I bought both DLC’s, because the game is excellent and so were they, but on the HD version it wants me to buy them again. I’m not sure how much control the devs had over this, but I wish they would at least put the old one back up, even as a free to play, just so we could play the DLC’s without having to buy them again. \n\nBut, if you didn’t have the DLC’s before and have no intention of deleting this from your phone to make room for something else (I believe you’ll have to buy the DLC’s again in this case too), it’s definitely worth your time and money.",

Then \nI froze in place and I was getting blasted to bits. I finally got right-side-up but I stayed frozen in place. I was at the part where I had to escape as well! This is a major glitch that must be fixed. To all developers, please fix this, otherwise this game is epic. The only reason why I gave this one star is because of this glitch and the rage afterwards. (I also became an enemy of one empire for seemingly no reason.) To all buyers this is the best game I have ever played and deserves its title as Num. 1 Sci-fi game ever, just keep note of this bug. If I find more glitches, I will make edits, if the glitch is fixed, I will raise my rating and remove this text. Thank you for listening/reading. :)",

I still enjoy this game like the day i first played it, alls i wish is there was more stuff added to do. I am not a fan of GOF3 due to it not feeling similar to this game whatsoever.",

Before the HD version of the game came out, models in the game just did not look fantastic, and the Jump drive really needed a new cut scene. I’m glad this HD version is available, thanks for 4000+ hours of enjoyment, still working to get more hours on the HD version, 48 hours at the moment, if you want to know, this is all the stuff I have gotten on the new version in the 2 days I have been grinding: 2,036333$ (credits), a Dark Angle, 4 M6 A4 “Raccoons” which are absolutely incredibly, a Khador drive, Gunant’s Drill, Yin Co. Shadow Ninja, 6 Rhoda Blackholes, T’yol, Me’al, every blueprint and hidden solar system on the free campaign, AB-3 “Kingfisher”, Fluxed Matter Shield, Hiroto Ultrascan, Ketar Repair Bot, Hammerhead D2A2, EMP GL II, and Intelli Jet. Thank you for reading if you have, and I really hope Deep Silver Fish Lab introduce the game with more campaigns besides the free campaign, Valkrie, and Supernova. \n\nA5 Artificial - Player of GOF 2 since 2011 and counting.",

There are endless customization options for your ship, and once you finish the story it is entirely open world and you can go wherever and do whatever. Not many games are like that. I really like the idea of having factions at war and if you attack a faction your reputation with them drops. \n\nAll in all, this is a true gem of a game and I have no negative feedback. I always say nothing is perfect, but that was before I found this game!",

It makes me miss alliances so much, that was a really cool game and i would definitely spend money on it, please bring it back!",

The gameplay is straight forward, the graphics are superior and there are multiple layers of play from good guy to bad guys, to merc and more. Even after all this time I don't find myself bored, unlike with other games of this genre I've played since I purchased this one. My only whine is that there aren't any patches or game extensions to add to this game. If there were, I'd buy them and wear them out as well.
