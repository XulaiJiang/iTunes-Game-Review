I think it would be great if more enemies are created. Perhaps a robot that when you destroy it, it creates or transforms into small robots that chase you down and do damage if they touch you (destroying them in the process) or perhaps enemies that can throw turrets when they see you, or think they see you. I like the new addition of Ava and her being the master mind is great. However, to me, this story was very different that the original and I was not as big of a fan. Also if you are wondering about the price believe me the app it’s self is worth it. However, the extension isn’t a great deal, however I expect they will add more great levels to it and make the purchase worth it.",

So tired of these bs money-grabbing credit games, I never pay for those and end up quitting just a short while into the game because you can’t do anything unless you pay them a ton of money.\n\nThis game is awesome, and pretty cheap. Fun gameplay. There’s action but also thinking. Reminds me a bit of old Nintendo games, but with much better graphics and better gameplay of course. If you’re into this kind of games buy it for sure, you won’t be disappointed. The aiming/shooting takes a little getting used to, but it wouldn’t be as fun if it was first person style I think. Another great game you should check out (not in a similar genre, just a cool game) Galaxy on Fire 2. That one also worth buying the extra missions. Also Fallout Shelter is super fun, and that one is free. I would pay just to reward the developers, but I buy pc versions of all Fallout games so I’ll just consider this a bonus. But I digress... or not. Games are fun, and I don’t even play that many, just the best ones, and these I listed are the best. 🤘👨‍💻👍",

When I try to shoot and move, there is a delay and my character doesn't move as I intended. My character died a couple of time but that was not big deal. The most frustrating part is at mission 4 where whenever I die, no matter how careful I want to click on \"restart at a check point\", the mission restarts. I have been doing the mission 4 for 3 times already. When my character dies, the mission restart regardless of me choosing the check point. This makes the game extremely difficult as I can't die in order to pass this mission. I looked for game support in the settings. I found none. This review only reflects part of this game. I still like this game if the bugs are fixed.",

Charming bits of story.  Huge amount of weaponry and armor available as mission rewards.  \nI played each level several times, happily.\nThe missions take a while (10-20 minutes?), so you have to sit down with a bit of time for this.  That's honestly the only negative about it.\nI almost never play a game to 100% completion, even if I like the game.  It takes a lot to keep me coming back.

This is oddly therapeutic. 😜 My only critique would be to allow a way to skip some of the dialogue for replays. Keep this missions coming please.",

I highly recommend this, and you don't have to play the first one to enjoy the second one (though it's amazing too - I recommend both). High replay value, and loads of fun!\n\nUpdate: So now there are new levels with Ava! I'm so glad. I think they're well worth the small price, and hope to see more of this in the future. I am glad the game creators are continuing on this project; it's my favorite game. So Ava is different - more strategic, which I really like! She doesn't have the firepower, so you are forced to use stealth mode a lot and do some takedowns. It's a fun new challenge!",

The controls are very well made.(this is the type of game that if the controls weren't made well, it would mess up the whole thing). The story is hilarious and interesting. But what truly amazes me are game mechanics and the gameplay. It is extremely addicting to shoot and sneak attack outlaws (by the way I love the new sneak attack feature). YOU CAN EVEN DUCK BEHIND THINGS! It's the mechanics of a real gunfight in the Wild West. Rapping this up, I HUGELY recommend this to virtually anybody.\n\nAva Mission Pack Review\n\nThe minute I saw the developers had made a new pack add - on, I bought it. It only cost $3! Honestly, it should have cost at least $5 judging by its quality. I feel like we are robbing the developers. Anyways, I love the drones. They are so amazing to control (especially the demolition drones. I love zooming into a group of enemies and then blowing them up). The main reason I did this review was because THERE IS A HUGE GLITCH, the kind that helps players. On level 11, The Exorcism, there is a huge glitch. When you plug in TAMI a.k.a. GAIA and GAIA tells you to go get TAMI and leave, if you go close but not to close to      TAMI, and press the button to get her, GAIA will not take TAMI away, and you will get TAMI. Then, you don't have to get all of TAMI's shards and you skip literally half the level.",

It’s fine to take risks, but this is a prime example of how keeping a sequel mostly unchanged can work wonders.\nI cannot wait for Space Marshals 3! It is bound to be a thing of beauty.
