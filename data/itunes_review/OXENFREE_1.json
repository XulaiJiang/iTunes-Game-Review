I have played this game so many times seeing what other endings I could uncover. There are many scares and sentimental moments! In general I love this game but I want more. I would love if there is a before, more in depth storyline for the game. Basically I was hoping for a “before they got to the island” app. Expecting more on how Alex’s brother died, their parents,How  Alex got her hair dyed.\n\nThanks again for this amazing game and thanks for reading.",

I hate buying a game and realizing after the purchase, it was not for me. \n\nSecond the story line was so interesting I couldn’t put the game down. I was so worried I would make a wrong choice and lose one of the characters. Yes even Clarissa. Smh. Even to the end made me want to play another time to see where the story would take me. I can’t leave out how great and relatable the personalities of each character, the interactions btwn them and how the dialogue was what I would might actually say as a response. You guys are imaginative, creative and fun. I would love to spend a day with you and pick the brain of the creator. \n\nLastly I loved the art. It was beautiful. I can’t wait to see or play any game that is made by you guys. I rarely write any review whether it’s positive or negative. Just don’t have the time, but I had to write this one. I just couldn’t leave without giving you guys your earned positive review. You guys really got me through a tough week where I could leave my chaos and disappear into fun, thrilling and exciting place. Thank you!!!!!!",

I thought maybe I needed to buy the full story, so I did and it still didn’t work. Please help me.\n Besides for that problem, it’s pretty amazing so far.

It’s got a good balance of eerie and sweet, enough that I’m looking over my shoulder when I hear weird noises, but I’ll still be able to fall asleep. The gameplay is giving me some serious tv show vibes (Locke and Key, Haunting of Hill House, and even Stranger Things, all for reasons I won’t explain, bc spoilers). I’ve played it about 1.5 times at this point, and I really like that it has enough structure so I don’t really get stuck, but my choices (apparently) can still lead to slightly different outcomes! Even though I’ve “finished” the game, there’s still a lot more for me to discover, and (hopefully) a few more outcomes! Really makes it feel worth the $5, since I will definitely play it again. Also want to mention that I LOVE how there’s some... aftereffects playing it the second time. My only complaint would be that the movement can be a little buggy sometimes, like it won’t let me climb up a wall, and I just have to walk away and come back a couple times. Even with this minor issue, I 10/10 recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a bit of creepiness!",

I’ve played it over and over and over, and I am never disappointed with the amount of new choices; I love the plot, the characters, and the humor and horror that are beautifully blended together. I will say that moving the radio, switching channels, is a little tedious at times. I also wish this game had a save button, or saved at any point between entering the bomb shelter and the very end. But— and I cannot stress this enough— THE GAME IS WORTH IT. It’s been like three months since I got it, and I can’t stop replaying.\n\nThis game is amazing. It’s chilling, funny, heartwarming, and beautiful. I cannot write a good enough review, but I hope this will do. 🙂",

It’s a game I’d suggest to all horror fans and even non horror fans. There is something in the game for everyone and anyone.\n\nAlso, I suggest listening to Vaporwave music or the Stranger Things soundtrack while playing this. It makes it so much better. Then again, there is the already amazing soundtrack within the game itself :D",

But I can’t get past the tutorial because it won’t let me tap on the radio or the pause because it’s off screen or something. I can see it but when I tap on it nothing happens. I don’t know if it’s just my phone model (XR) or what but the game doesn’t even take up all of the screen, there’s like half an inch or so of black, open screen that could be used. It’s extremely difficult to admire the hard work that was put into the art and story that is clearly put into the game because you can hardly even see the game. I understand that you have to pay to get the full game which makes complete sense because you wouldn’t want ads popping up in the middle of the story and the devs need the money to make more games and what not. My only problem is that I don’t know what I’m looking at or if it’s even worth paying for the full game if I can’t see anything. I would love to test out the game further than maybe 1 and a half minutes to see if it’s worth buying. I can tell that this game is amazing already from the little time I spent playing. I hope this can be fixed somehow and I hope that this helps!",
