Developer did not think this through. I would say the success rate to clear the board is maybe 1 in 20 games. If you get close to clearing it, you can actually get some money back in your bank, but not enough to cover your ante, so you will never unlock the true grit mode. \n\nAlso has accelerating ads. By that I mean they come more frequently as time goes on. First few days an ad every few games. Now it's an ad every game. Not worth it to me to pay for ad removal when the game is fundamentally flawed. \n\nGood attempt but could be better.",

Once you get a decent high score, it's next to near impossible to beat it because it's basically a maximum. The vegas mode is completely broken. You start with $500 and a minimum of a $50 ante. Your payout is based on a multiplier you increase by clearing the top two rows of cards. Even if you successfully clear the entire board and get the bonus multiplier you don't make your ante back meaning you always lose money from the bank regardless. Vegas mode should really be called \"completely broken and not thought out mode designed so you will never unlock true grit mode even though you paid $2.99 to unlock mode\".

                    "label": "This is my favorite game; my 'go-to game. It's unique, a different breed of solitaire that I've never seen before. It's deceptively simple to play, but quite a challenge to win (by clearing the board, beating your highest score, or if you want, competing against the leaderboards and other challenges). It offers tons of backgrounds, card backs, ways to play, and fun 'awards' with a sense of humor - all in a seamless, simple and uncluttered format. Brilliantly done!! \n\nThere are different options of play, like \"Vegas Style\", \"Single Deck\", \"Double Deck\" and a couple more. I've been playing Single Deck all along and still not bored! I look forward to trying the others.\n\nUPDATE: Aug 2016\nWanted to review again, after the latest update. Everything I said in original review still stands, and then some! I still play this game all the time - still my go-to game after all these months! I Never get bored of it. Since my last review I tried out the 15-mode game, and I am addicted! I also tried Vegas style, and definitely have a lot of room to grow on that one :-o. I love the challenge of it. I am also very glad the game lets me reset my bank back to where it started. (I wasn't doing so bad, but my husband tried and he really put me in debt!). I can't say enough about Sage Solitaire! Thank you, zac (i think that's the right name for who created this game)... you are a genius!!",

It's difficult to win, when trashing cards it gives you a card of the same value plus  the rule of having to have cards in separate rows  to create a hand makes it impossible to actually win a hand; there is nothing to suggest that if I pay that these 2 things can be changed or that they will go away. Otherwise it seems like it might be fun. It has a lot of potential, I just can't see me playing it often since currently I have no chance of winning at it.

Been on the fence for awhile. Gonna buy it now. Thanks!\n\nFirst Update:\nStill haven't bought the full version yet, but added another star for the great update. This app dev cares about his app and his customers.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nThanks for the free version of the game. Great design and fun, although short (which I assume is what the double deck is for).\n\nWhile I understand the double deck, what the heck is fifteens mode? I don't see a description or preview anywhere. Also could we get a preview of the other unlocks? Wanna make sure I know what I'm buying. Thanks!",
