The obstacles are vary and is soooo fun to solve\nThe story and the characters themselves as well the music come together so well, I have nothing to complain about the plot it has, the game is just stunning and reflect a fantastic result of the team! \n\nI am looking forward to see more developments and new games from you! The best puzzle game ever!",

The ending was horrid though and I actually can’t believe they would end it with such an easy and short level. I would pay another $4 for a much more challenging and fun last level BUT that part aside it’s a great game and def worth the money!",

I’m a huge gamer, from triple A games to indie games like Sally Face, Fran Bow, Machinarium, etc. Somehow this one slid right past me and now I’m telling everyone about it. I’m not sure I can really compare this game to anything, it kind of made me feel the way To The Moon did? Just be ready to break out the tissue box!! Also mega kudos to the devs for not making this a gacha game in any way. You will never see another $ sign after u pay for it and there is about 30 ish levels I believe? And each level takes me up to about 15 min. Basically what I’m saying is this is a complete game for a mere $4 with almost the same quality as all the other games I listed above. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes indie, story, puzzle, point and click, or adventure games. I did read some critical reviews that the story was thin and shallow and that there weren’t any puzzles involved. I mean it’s true there is no dialogue and it’s only “memory” videos aside from the gameplay, but it’s still an amazing game. No it’s not Life is Strange but it’s still perfection in its own way. Also there is a lot of clicking but it’s a point in click lol, saw that complaint too. What did you expect? You can play mindlessly and just walk around clicking until you get it correct, or you can think about it logically and B line to the correct location to do the puzzle. No this game won’t challenge you like The Witness but it def still has a problem solving aspects. Anyway, if you go into it without comparing it or with a negative attitude, and just accept the game for what it is, you’re going to have a good time :)",

The places he had to go through were pretty and very detailed, the thing that I loved is that the boy still had his love for her 🥰🥰🥰. But that 1%. That 1%. That 1% was how hard it was to find the memories. The memories were easy at the beginning but then started to get harder, I really wanted to watch all of it so I don’t need to watch any videos. And also, in that 1% was how slow he walked, I kinda wanted him to walk a bit faster or run, but overall, IT WAS AMAZING! You don’t need to fix it because this is my opinion but if you did, then thank you! I will be downloading this again but I don’t have enough room to download this amazing game but I promise, I WILL BUT IT AGAIN🤗🤗🤗🤗\nThat’s all!\nPs: please make more games like this!",

And how how nova did react to kosmo hugging her which led me to theorize, although that could just be me, cuz I don’t want this to end!\n\nThe sweet was how Kosmo finally after all that hustle,was able to embrace his love again and (I hope) live a happily ever after with his true love.\n\nNow, to explain the title.This is a demand, but, please make some type of sequel or prequel or anything just involving the same characters,(somewhat of) the same plot that would truly make my day, month or even year, it’ll keep me very happy for lot more than just a hot second if there was more.\n\nGreat game Nintendo, Thanks.\n\n👌🏻\n\nNo but seriously great job make more games I’m sure they will be great\n\nIt’s not the end just wanted to say real quick best game since tiny thief cya \nAnd remember to always where your seat belts...",
