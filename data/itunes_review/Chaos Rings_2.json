My only wish, especially as I purchased the game so I own my copy, is that I have no way to earn ohnz coins faster.  Items using ohnz coins are expensive but rewards for quests are cheap...only one per quest.  Why can't I purchase more coin or maybe the quest levels should pay more depending on their level.  Other than that this is the best game I have found in a long time.  Hope you are creating more.  Oh and I found this game at number three in the series and can't find the others at the App Store...is there a reason why they are no longer available?",

When it first came out there were glitches, but to my knowledge they’ve all been fixed. \nI just wish the earlier games were still available. So yeah! Good game! Highly recommend it!",

Squareenix I just hope you continue to release great games like this that again don’t cost more than your average game on the App Store but give you a real console game with no in app purchases ( which with a lot of games will cost you more) great work on this masterpiece!",

Please fix.> For once I actually feel like the game I payed for is worth every penny. They put so much work into this and if they just made a game with this much effort every so often for the mobile market, they could change mobile gaming forever. It's like having one of the final fantasy's for ps2 but on your mobile device. Amazing story, balanced gameplay, lots of stuff to do and it's not short like I expected. I'm so pleased with Square Enix and this game that words can't describe how pleasing this game is to me. PLEASE square, put this much time into mobile games more often and I promise you that you'll make so much money and give so many people hope for mobile gaming. It's the first time I feel like square didn't con somebody out of money. Keep it up guys and you have my bills on an product of this caliber.",

People who think this game is expensive are right however, it is also Four times bigger than the first one and four times the characters.. The gameplay is also more refined from the first one, with  more summoners that can also be leveled up. How this game differentiates from the first is the it is in full 3-D and is more immersive/ interactive! \n     Overall, The $20 price-tag is expensive, but considering that the game is more immersive with full3D, has extensive characters/environments, is 75+ hours long where most other mobile games are only 4-5 hours long and is specifically made for mobile more than justifies the cost! I can't wait for the direct sequel to Chaos Rings 3!!!",

That in itself is rare to find on the ios app store.\nCons: leary and elroux have small breasts, need to give them an upgrade. Con 2: main character and his outfit look ripped from kh series, his arms also need some muscle, not a lot, but some so he doesnt look same model as the girls. Con 3: needs a way to get more ohnz besides doing quests over and over, like a npc or store that you can exchange mh for ohnz, or give us more than 1 ohnz as reward from quests. Con 4: some of the items, cards skill ability descriptions need a spellchecker and proofreader.\nCon 5: not sure if the achievements are working on ios, when i hit achievements in options screen, it takes me to a screen that say achievements unavailable and says rate it and facebook likes unavailable. Please fix.\nI finally downloaded cr 3 and am enjoying it a lot, please bring back the earlier games in the series, ill buy them. lol \nAlso found a bug that is similar to the earlier reported magma ocean/infared camera bug that jellyaintjamming reported in an earlier review. If you go to winter wonderland blizzard area and encounter a snow dragon and use analzye on it it crashes to desktop or the main screen of your ios device. I say it may be similar, because they both are triggered by infared camera or analyze, which is basically the same game effect. Also sometimes during the hunts in winter wonderland it also crashes randomly, can't figure out the cause yet. Hope you guys can fix these bugs and crashes soon.",

I love the references to the earlier games and the hidden little Easter eggs you find as you talk to npcs throughout the game.

                    "label": "This feels like an older generation turn based JRPG game, which is amazing to me. This game is similar to Persona in several aspects. If I had to describe this game in a few words it would be touching, light hearted, and dark in ways.\n\nNow the storyline itself is kind of dark but it's presented in a light hearted way. It basically revolves around friendship is power, humanity is twisted, and fate of the world lies on you. Kind of typical actually. What kept me interested was the diversity of personalities, the mystery behind characters, and how they fit into the story. The entire game is English subbed with Japanese voiceovers.\n\nWhat gameplay should you expect on a daily basis? Repetitive side quests, arena experience grind, collecting gifts in dungeons, and then there is the main story line. I find myself talking to all the same NPCs repeatedly or doing side quests every time the story progresses a little there are details you miss out on if you focus too much on just the main quests. \n\nWhat I enjoyed about the music was how the main OST was presented. It made a strong impact on how certain scenes were felt. It's not so much that the music itself made the difference but it's more about how the story builds up to a certain point, how you've worked for so hard to reach somewhere, and it turns out to be this touching scene.\n\nI don't have anything bad to say except the repetitiveness can grow tiring, but what game doesn't have some repetition to it? Also, usually I don't mind when the protagonist is silent but for some reason I wish he would speak in this game. I think the reason being is because I feel as if some scenes would be more emotional if he just spoke instead of standing there all silent. Imagine playing Kingdom Hearts but Sora never talks.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game a lot I give it a 5/5. If you enjoy most JRPGs out there I recommend this game.",

Want my money back square!!!\n2/16\nMan hands one of the funniest square Enix franchises in the App Store and this one definitely adds up to the others.  Some Weapons are very unique and cool to look at.  Story is ok for now.  I haven't gotten too far into the game but I'm sure the story will grow. Genes are pretty cool.  Again I haven't gotten far but hopefully you can upgrade the star ranks.  And hopefully at least 2 more characters come into play... Looks like there is tho.   And I'm not giving it five stars simply because the voices are Japanese.  We waited this long for this update square.....at least update to English dub.",

The only issue I have is with the currency system, but in a way it keeps you from binging on the game so it lasts longer. Definitely of console quality, and could have easily been labeled final fantasy",
