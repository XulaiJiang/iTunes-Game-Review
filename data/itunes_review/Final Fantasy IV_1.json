The bonus dungeons at the end of each chapter are beyond awesome...wait, maybe that’s the Wii version but anyhow I played them both!  Loved how you got to revisit stuff EXCEPT for the Waterway between Damcyan Castle and Kaipo. Having to go through there sooooooooooo many times became a real chore. Other than that, the story needed alittle more depth but great if your a fan like me!",

Not a deal breaker, but disconcerting. There is much to love about this game, and it verges on interactive fiction, which emphasizes the storyline over the martial prowess of characters.  \n\nStoryline is clever, kind of reminds me of Saga Frontier (in that you get to play several different characters, but with better graphics). Square Enix unfortunately has recently been following the lead of more notorious companies by suffocating the genre with IAPs. I hope they change this, because to many fans of this genre, that IS a deal-breaker.",

Being able to pick and choose between different characters and their individual stories and seeing how they all intertwine with one another to the end is brilliant. And by far the strongest part of this sequel is the mind blowing story line. Although I must say that I was very much intrigued by the incredibly mysterious approach they took with the structuring, it got to be a little frustrating after 40+ hours of gameplay and you still don't know what the blazes is going on! But at the very last moment of the game every finally comes to a head, and I would have to say it's the biggest revelation in all of FF history, making it all worth it. Other that the slightly weak gameplay in comparison to the others, it was an amazing experience and I highly recommend it. EVERY Final Fantasy fan needs this piece of the story puzzle‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️",

You can buy 5 level bands and gain levels in no time at all to catch up. Had no crashing issues what so ever. Playing on iOS 8 with an iPhone 6 Plus. Highly recommended to all FF IV fans.",

If they would have had 1 month to just perfect and complete this game, and add all features from the original game. Then this game would have been epic.\n\nJust like Sonic Boom, they have tested the debugging before releasing it.\n\nBottom line is really I would rather pay 40$ for the original than this uncompleted crap. No offense to square enix (they are great), or its developers for trying (well not really trying TO AT LEAST FINISH THE GAME). I love Final Fantasy 4 The After Years, but this remake is disappointing, I would have liked to do all the extra features that the original had in 3D.\nSo i'd still give a 4/5 Great Game and Story, but needs everything from the original to be Amazing.",

Your remake apps are of horrible quality, something amateurs could do better than. From the graphics to the code. This game is very slow, and I can see each frame go by, on my iphone 5. The only time it is remotely smoothe is when it is on auto battle, and the speed adjustments do nothing. The graphics are pixelated polygon quality at best, and the animations have no work put into them. I was looking forward to finally playing this installment, but Im going to wait until gameplay is actually smoothe and enjoyable. I wouldnt recommend this game until bonus content and graphical and lag issues are addressed.",

Still it would have been nice to get an equivalent or something nice for leveling at the end of each chapter.\n\nThe final dungeon got super stripped. Where are the FFI-VI bosses? Doom train? Omega?

But there's more bad news: they did not mention that all the bonus bosses in the final dungeon from other cameo FF games are gone and replaced by recycled IV bosses (including ultima weapon). And the fact that you can't farm adamantite to get adamant armor sets for the entire team, but just one set (adamantites are final rewards in challenge dungeons). Plus, you also don't get the developers office (or maybe it's a different location that no one's discovered) where you could trade in items to get more goodies. One of the worst things they did was mess with the final dungeon's layout. It's bad enough the tailed monsters that drop rare tails can be found in a single room in the dungeon, but what's worse is the monster shows up only in 1/4 phase of the moon. Determining which monster is where is practically impossible without a guide, which are all wrong because iOS version is different. This problem could easily be remedied with a siren that triggers rare encounters in a given room, but for some idiotic reason, sirens have been taken out of the game!!!",
