I payed for this game after reading the reviews and people said it was such a good game. I was told that it was such a scary game just what I was looking for. At first I gave it a few levels and then gave it a break. Then in the next few days when I played it I asked myself, \" What did I buy?\" And finally deleted the game.  MY TIP: WATCH THE TRAILER AND UNLESS YOU ARE AFRAID OF LINES THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A GOOD HORROR GAME FOR YOU",

It’s quite unresponsive, it just feels weird to have to draw a line off to the side, and don’t even talk to me about trying to throw one while in the water while not budging enough to blow your cover.

But this one is really make me excited.\nI didn't get what is it at the first, after reading some of the reviews, I decided to give it a try. First, I have to say I love watching horror movies. However, movies sometimes can be tedious. You can not feel you are actually in the scene. But this game somehow is quite different. After you plugged in your headphones, you are the character. You can feel the fear. You can feel something is chasing after you. But you can't see. Unknown, that's what make you scared. \nDownload it, if you love horror movies, and play it at night. Good luck.",

                    "label": "I know my opinion doesn't really matter, but maybe it can save you from wasting a $1.99. The game is quite repetitive. But, it's incredibly fun for a while. If there were more mechanics and the price was .99 I would easily recommend this as one of the better horror games on the App Store. Well, if you can call it a horror game. This game was never scary, just creepy. I was never even close to being scared, even with headphones in the dark. The horror element was never really there for me. But, if your looking for an intuitive echolocation-based adventure game with sharp, responsive controls, stealth elements and a lot of suspense at times this is for you.",

It even came to the point where I stopped playing for a bit cuz it was so scary (not TOO much though) and I like the reality of it, you being stuck in the darkness with monsters and you using sound to find a way out, But monsters also using the sound you make to hunt you down.  It's a cool game would definitely recommend it.",
