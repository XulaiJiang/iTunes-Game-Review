And it’s not even summer! In fact, I think I customized it specifically so it wouldn’t have seasons, so I could explore the game without having to worry about the cold, the wet, and the heat. I could just explore the game and what it had to offer. I could deal with the seasons at a later time when I’m more familiar with that game, but having to deal with heat WHEN I ASKED FOR NO HEAT is really tedious.\n\nAlso, not to mention, I think some knight boats randomly spawned near my base for some reason even though I asked for fewer. It’s good to have them for gears I guess, ya know, to make a fridge and stuff, but they’re in the way of the island where I kept my Doy doys! There’s like, three of them there and I don’t know why! I’m pretty sure they weren’t there when I first discovered the island, so I’m not sure why they’re there now!\n\nFurther more, there are more glitches that need to be fixed but I don’t think I have room to put them all here. Overall, great game, but needs work.",

I use it as a challenge to see how many days I can survive and to dig out the secrets. I want to unlock and discover everything. Maybe there’s a way to escape? Maybe not? Only as the days continue, Will I probably find out.\nLastly, the bugs. It’s terrible. I would give it five stars but I my character glitching in the game as my days get longer. The music starts to get all disoriented and that’s not just from losing my sanity. My sanity can be perfectly fine but the music isn’t. Then the colors start to fade, which is annoying because everything goes to a gray color. The birds don’t even sound like birds anymore. Even when I close out the game and open it again, it fixes it for a while and then it goes back to crap again. Please fix. \nOther than this, I would recommend to anyone looking for a challenge within a stunning game.",

It’s up to you to decide, based on the gameplay itself, do you like the game. It’s not about my opinion or theirs, it’s about YOUR opinion. This game is a work of art, you don’t have to appreciate it, others will. You don’t have to understand it, because trust me, OTHERS WILL.

At least add something in the game that you can make friends with. I still like the game how it is but needs a bit of an upgrade. I hope this was helpful to everyone bye.",

Don’t Starve and Shipwrecked are the ONLY games that I own on three different platforms (PC, iPhone, and XBox1) because I love being able to play the different versions and have it in my pocket for free time or marathons at home on PC or Xbox. \n\nBut when I’m playing on mobile, it’s incredibly easy for real life to distract me and for my character to die. That stinks. I play strictly “No Sweat” on Don’t Starve and was expecting a similar version on Shipwrecked when I recently purchased it. \n\nAn update including a “No Sweat” option would be incredibly appreciated! \n\nThank you Klei Entertainment for an amazing series of games that have kept me entertained, frustrated, and surprised for YEARS!! \n\n(PS, I’m totally going to reference your games in a homebrew DND campaign that I’m writing for my close friends and current party members!)",

When using the virtual joystick to control your character, if you try to use both the joystick and your action buttons, the joystick will freeze in the current direction you have it as long as the action button is held. Can this be fixed? It’s a huge annoyance when trying to harvest materials and the character walks right by them and gets killed. \n\n2. When utilizing a chest, it is absolutely impossible to see what is inside it. I’ve noticed that when you select your current inventory, it zooms in so you can see the contents, why can’t chests and Packim Baggins do the same thing? That’s a huge annoyance as well for someone like me who loves coordination.\n\n3. Instead of having to use two fingers on the top or bottom to switch viewing angles, why not have arrows on the upper corners of the screen like the bumper inputs on a PS4 controller? Having to use two fingers is wonky as hell since half the time you’re zooming in and losing all focus anyhow. \n\nThese are all easily repairable if you guys read these reviews, please do so!",

Your character will just stand still, making some comment about the tree you just clicked on, while some monster chomps away at him! It’s especially bad since a lot of the fighting requires you to hit the enemy a couple times before running a small distance away to dodge their attack. You need to make sure you’re in a wide open space to fight anything effectively.\nAlso, you can’t play as Wigfrid (my favorite character), so you can’t just tank the enemy attacks.",
