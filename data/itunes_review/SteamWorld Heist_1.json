Procedurally generated levels, reactive enemy AI, and a seemingly endless loot table of “rare” weapons and gear make it infinitely replayable.  And then there’s the hats.  When a rare, as yet uncollected hat adorns the head of an enemy, you will risk everything to spend a turn shooting it off rather than deliver max damage.  I’ve played thru on “experienced” “veteran” and “elite” difficulties, and still want more.  Elite is ruthless.  But in a good way.\n\nThere are just enough RPG elements to let you invest your imagination without option paralysis.  The shared inventory size doesn’t allow for nostalgia over your early gear.  While loading-out for a mission, each crew member gets to equip only 4 things. Each has their own ability progression, but no choices to leave you pondering options. The variety comes from which members you develop by taking them on missions.\n\nThe only technical glitch I’ve encountered is that sometimes after playing a good while (an hour or 3), the sound effects track goes silent.  Restarting the app restores it.  Otherwise rock-solid.\n\nCan’t wait for the sequel!\n\n[Devs:  Please please PLEASE port the “Outsider” DLC to iOS!]",

They are really unnecessary and it’s cumbersome to click all over the ship to talk to the other characters for no reason. I guess it’s supposed to be cute or funny?

At least half of them are just a veneer for micro-transactions, many are ports of games that are much better experienced the way they were intended, and the ones that you can tell are from original creative developers that LOOK SO GOOD in the trailers often just feel incomplete and underwhelming after about an hour. If you love mobile games, that’s great, I’m glad for you.\n\nMy entire point is that if you are like me and you keep finding disappointment in this medium, this is one of those 7 or 8 diamonds in the rough games on iOS. It’s fun for a mobile game, it’s fun for a game just in general—the game is just a lot of fun. Play it on veteran difficulty, get a scoped pistol as soon as possible, and have a blast ricocheting bullets into robot skulls, with light but well done RPG mechanics. Worth 5 bucks.\n\nPS If you do happen to read this, happen to feel similar to me, and buy the game and happen to enjoy it, go buy the Banner Saga trilogy too.\n\nThanks",

Fight back evil and keep on finding more and more bigger, badder enemies ahead. Highly would recommend to anyone who enjoys good old pirate steam punk themed action! Only request I have is to have the DLC available on iOS. To have that added will give the game even more replay value and the extra weapons and items would be a welcomed addition to anyone’s game. Thank you Devs for such a wonderful game I hope to see more of this fine work in the future!",

I know there are only three campaigns but seriously why three. Can there be different story lines to go through throughout the game. Also a multiplayer mode would be really cool having other players bots vs yours. I think that would be a really great addition to the game. The last thing is that the character choices are a bit blank. There are only so many slots but cant there be more allys to choose from in the game. Otherwise this game really stands out from all the others I’ve played, Nice job.",

After that is gets very easy because the characters you play with are fully buffed with abilities.  But the enemies are more varied and you find more crew.\nI also like that at any level you can change the games difficulty level.  How nice is that!\n\nCons are the replay value is “why bother?”.  You do not get any areas new to explore or new abilities / stages to unlock after winning the game.  \n\nThere are 5 difficulty levels as I mentioned, so a bit more on that now... \nThe “experienced” is the standard medium.  Anything less challenging and the game is too easy and goes too quick.  “Veteran” is like a hard mode.  “Elite” is a I am a glutton for punishment and abuse mode, especially in the beginning of the game.  But as stated, the replay factor is not there so after the first run through you likely will not want to invest the hours to play again so my suggestion is try the hardest level first and scale back if it’s too difficult.  You lose nothing this way during first play through.",

                    "label": "To people thinking that this game is about a proper cowboy action game, well, they probably don’t look to Apple mobile store anyway. This is actually a perfect example of how the marketplace (not just apple store) is littered with literally 100% “you can’t use this weapon because you are playing this X class” games, and the ones that allow it are all PvP games only. Real cowboys just do whatever they want, so the nerd hypocrisy and worship as a cult religion is written all over the place, while being triggered when asking for more of a moderate balance (which is why it is a bad thing, not a good thing). That’s why this game only gets a three, but most people won’t know this! because yes it’s very well done for yet another dungeons and dragons strategy rpg (when has that not yet been done before?). Will continue to rate low and people should do so until the market for all games reaches more of a fifty fifty balance so that everyone can be happy. Can’t please everyone with just DND. With that said, this game manages to have a nice balance of action, after the fact that players will be faced with mostly female robot characters crafted by mostly developers with foreign European names. It’s bizarre to say the least, but at least aiming guns is sort of intuitive, until characters shake their hands (even being robots) which will throw off some players’ aim that are seeking weapons without laser sights and the four slot inventory also has some weird failings like not being able to equip armor if people want grenades and a medpak. However the gunshots, explosions, robotic parts gibs (hats and all), remains to be satisfying, and the cowboy theme with steam and water actually picks the game off the otherwise incredibly massive list of problems with the game weighing it down to the floor. With the world so flocking to DND, can see why this game gets a five or four, but not from the rest of us. 🤠",

Also, I think I’ve only ever left like one or two reviews in the years I’ve had my iPhone because most games are decent and there are plenty of awesome classic RPGs, newer Indy games, etc. but I almost never feel like it’s awesome enough for me to write a review. That’s not the case for this gem.\n\nThey integrated a strategy into a 2D world perfectly, the dialogue/characters are awesome and surprisingly developed with their own personalities, the game play is fluid and super satisfying..I could go on but instead I’m just gonna tell you to stop reading these reviews and get it. It’s seriously 5 dollars. I wouldn’t have felt ripped off even if it had cost me $20..but the awesome devs made it cheap enough for almost anyone to get. So make sure you’re near a charger because you’re about to drain the hell out of your battery from not being able to put it down!\n\nAnd on the super small off chance that the dev(s) see this, please keep making games. I absolutely love how you spend money to buy the game and get the actual game without being bombarded with ads and pop ups begging you to give them money for their “premium” currency. Nope, you spend 5 bucks and the game is 100% yours. The designs/art is phenomenal and the bright color palette is so pleasing to the eyes..so I really hope you all have something in the works after seeing that almost 100% of the reviews are 5 stars and that the very few negative ones are almost all due to something other than the game itself. So again, thank you so much for this awesome and cheap game!",
