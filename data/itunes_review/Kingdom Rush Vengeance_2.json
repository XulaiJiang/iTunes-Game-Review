Anyway, Kingdom rush fanboy through and through, so I’m going to be harsh. Decent game, but compared to the first two and even the third, lacking. I’m going to be real here. Ive played kingdom rush since I was probably 8 or 9. Easily one of the best games I’ve ever played. Tower defense usually, IMO, aren’t fun or complex enough to peak my interest. KR is the exception. The way it’s designed makes it sooo much fun. I love it. KR 1 and KR frontiers (the latter being my personal favorite) are amazing. Origins is less aesthetically pleasing (the mushroom forest is purple.... yeah), and the towers are less interesting, but it still has whatever makes KR amazing in its DNA. Vengeance doesn’t do it for me. It falls back with other tower defense games. No story that makes you sentimental when you finish it. The soundtrack is lacking and kinda of annoying at times. The heroes are bland and unremarkable. They add a humorous element in, but it makes the story seem trivial and unserious, whereas in previous games humor didn’t take away from the story. Enemies are easy to defeat. The skill tree is inferior compared to previous games. There’s no reason to do heroic or iron challenges. Towers are unbalanced. Ironically, them adding in more towers leads to less tower diversity, because two or three towers always get used no matter what because of the balance problem. And finally The biggest problem I have, the towers. In old KR games, there were four basic towers, and when you got to level 4, they turned into one of two specialized towers of your choice that worked in different ways. In this game, the towers do not change in this way, they just get stronger, minus special abilities at max level. Now there are some good things. The environments were stellar. They were a little too polished for me, but they did a good job. Not as good as KR frontiers, where there was jungle, pirate coves, underground caves, and desert, but still good. The premise of being vez’nan is interesting. I wish they took him a little more seriously, but it still works. The bosses are pretty good, they are hard and interesting. But if you haven’t played the first three, there’s no point in playing this one. Play the first three first, in order, or if you just want one, I’d recommend frontiers.",

This one is disappointing because even though the team says the game is designed to be beaten without any add-ons, it’s very difficult EVEN ON CASUAL MODE to beat the extra levels at the end. There’s lots of extra content like heroes and towers that you need to pay (quite a lot!) for and having already paid $5 for the game they should be lower priced or AT LEAST a package for all towers or all heroes for like, $10. And just having an option to pay $50 for a bunch of gems is ridiculous to me. The team has turned kinda greedy. Please make some changes to my favorite tower defense game creators!!",

You ironhide game studios were to read this we need a new one plz or a remake of anyone but with a mode that we crest what happens like how much gold we have how much enemy’s come out against us and so much more. Plus I like all the updates on vengeance ecsept for the polx one that one I don’t like to do. BTW THANK YOU FOR THE AMAZING GAME",

Also, I wish we can have a longer level where we can fully maxed out every tower on the maps, or the level wouldn’t ended even we defeated the final boss.

It’s the reason you keep playing after you’ve beaten every level. If this game gets an Endless mode added, it would be an EASY 5 stars. Its my personal favorite installment in the series.",

I think it would be neat if you could swap out abilities like the goonies or green fire rain for different abilities like how you can with the heroes. And more free heroes.",
