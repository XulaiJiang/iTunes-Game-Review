My biggest problem is the number of bugs I encounter that I never saw on Alto’s Adventure. Jumping off a large hill with the lemur chasing you often ends up with the lemur appearing to run through the air. Today everything on the screen disappeared except for the score until eventually the player crashed at which point it got stuck in a loop of in game messages and haptic feedback. If they could fix the bugs it would be so much more enjoyable.",

The music paired with the simple yet breathtaking graphics makes the game unforgettable. I’ve completed this whole game making it to level 61. The only complaint I might have is that once you get to the final level, there are no more challenges and you only play to have fun. Also coins don’t matter that much after you’ve unlocked everything unless you want to buy stuff to let you continue your run in which case you can just play zen mode instead unless you want to beat your high score",

                    "label": "This is a good game and is overall enjoyable. However I had to give up after only reaching level 33 or so. I can’t get one of the goals even after trying probably a hundred times and spending several hours on it, much more than any other goal.\n\nSome of the goals (like the one I’m stuck on) seem to be driven by chance, and so you have to either get lucky, or go far to meet them. After being stuck for so long, the minor issues can also become frustrating... like even though the game is gorgeous, it’s hard to see the character and rocks at night or in the rain. Or when you do a jump or backflip, occasionally you’ll wind up in a chasm that was offscreen when you started.\n\nHopefully for future versions or products the developers can make the goals less driven by chance, and make the game easier to see, especially at night. In a lot of ways I’d like it if the level was the same every run, instead of having it be different.\n\nOverall it’s a pretty fun game though.",

And every little bird, pond, plant life like the desert flower, and the ruins are paired along with the music to make the true perfect experience.

It is so peaceful, and beautiful, the colors are amazing, the features are really cool, and the desert...! The music is beautiful!!!\nAnyone who wanted a calming game should definitely play this.\n\nAnother thing that makes this game so unique is the weather. There’s rain and thunderstorms and sandstorms, but they actually are lifelike! The thunder comes after the lightning, and so on. Have you noticed there’s even eclipses! So well thought out... it really shows how much thought the creators put into this game. I love the biomes, and the water and balloon and sand and temples. The characters are so lovely too, and you can unlock such cool levels and features (like the wingsuit!) And the fact that you can see lemurs and birds of paradise(they’re sooo pretty!) makes this game really, really beautiful. \n\nI love this game so much. Even picking it up and playing one round makes you so happy and calm. The desert is endless, and beautiful. Thank you to the creators and devs! I love this game❤️",

The implementation of this feature is so lame: it cost a LOT of effort to get the coin for it and then you have to grind a ton of tricks to activate it only for a little while! And if you die it goes away until you grind a whole bunch of tricks AGAIN. Not good. For the amount of effort it takes, once you acquire it, it should be yours to use and activate as you see fit. That’s my big gripe with the game. I like everything else and it’s pretty nice to play. But that wingsuit...grrrr.",

Simple, pretty and fun.\n\nOdyssey improves upon what was already great. The backgrounds are livelier and the dynamic range is fantastic. While it doesn’t have HDR10 support you wouldn’t know it when playing with the brightness maxed. The sunrise and sunset look spectacular.",

At night, it’s almost impossible to see Alto. Additionally, the game zooming in and out every time you jump, the bird that follows you right above your head that is the same size as Alto, and the (to my memory) smaller size of Alto just add up to a very visually frustrating experience. It’s just hard to make out what’s happening on screen. \n\nI really liked the first game, and wanted to like this too, it’s just hard to focus on the playing when you can’t really see anything. I can’t imagine how visually impaired people could play this. Maybe all this is because I’m playing on a phone, and it’s different on an iPad, I don’t know. \n\nI completed Alto 1, and I appreciate the added game elements of the sequel; of course the music is fantastic as usual. I just didn’t find this sequel to be as accessible as the first due to the visual problems laid out above. I eagerly look forward to the next release from this game developer, whether it be another “Alto” installment or something new entirely.",

While the games graphics are very pleasing I doubt they are so demanding that the 7 core GPU is under so much stress it can’t output a smooth amount of frames.\n\nIf you could optimize it that would be great!",
