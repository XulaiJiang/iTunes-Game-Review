You may want to hurry to get back under 80 days early on and that’s fine, but even if you go over it’s a blast to go through all sorts of adventures and scrapes.  Just keep in mind you can start all over again when you return.  Also, some southern routes I thought there was no way to make it back in time but I did and had all sorts of wild things happen along the way including shipwrecks and surviving a shooting!  Still made it back on that one before 80 days.  Last trip I didn’t make it back until Day 111 but it was the most fun ever, including the Nautilus and mermaids!  Tip on North Pole if you want to survive, do everything, make friends with everyone or you won’t make it.  So don’t be afraid to try new routes, meet new people, explore and have fun along the way.  Endlessly playable.  5 stars.",

I especially loved the piece on the untold stories of people that \"progress\" leaves behind.\n- Still can't tell if I love or hate the Artificers Guild, but the politics are intriguing and got to love the explosives\n- Making money from great sales\n- Bribery through costume to get some cheap tickets\n\nCons: \n- Time passes too quickly to be able to effectively buy or sell before morning departures, forcing you to stay the night\n- Some options become less relevant later in the game, like socializing at the hotel\n- Starting items are pretty random\n- No bonus points for having your boss like you\n- If you want to \"win\" and take the most efficient route you miss out on cool stories :( \n- Hard to keep track of the politics and \"quests\"\n\nProtips:\nIf you selected wrong on one of the text selections, close out of the app and relaunch to reset your choices for the current scene. Only works if you haven't finished the scene.\nAlso, stay away from Muscat.",

You start with a meager suitcase and rush off to race around the world in 80 days. But the journey will be nothing that you expect. \n\nThe game play is simple. It’s a choose your own adventure with some inventory management, time management, area exploration, and keeping Fogg alive and well. You can buy and sell curio items for profits. You can buy items to make the travel less strenuous. You can buy items that allow conversation during travel longer and more fruitful. Managing your inventory is a large part of a successful journey. \n\nFor downsides, I wish the app had more documentation. You gain statuses like “steadfast” or “well mannered” but there’s no indication of how these affect gameplay. To me, they’re 100% useless as I have no idea of why I would want them or what it does. Maybe it opens new choices? Who knows.\n\nFor upsides, the adventures are epic. But I enjoy the fact that you can find romance with a man or a woman, making it more LGBT friendly. Also, it seems that your character has African decent, and it certain areas race is taken seriously. These touches really made me happy. \n\nYou won’t be disappointed if you buy this app. My suggestion is to take the strangest routes, try to always hit different cities, and have an adventure!",

But this game is still great, if you are looking to read something and have an interactive adventure at the same time, this game is perfect for you. This game might even be educational on some levels. If you want an action packed thriller of an adventure, the money this costs will not go to waste. The reason I am leaving a four star and not a five is because at times the game can get annoying, and that can make it fun. It was all realistic just like the movie until, I got lost on ice and kidnapped by mermaids and I lost the game because of that. Overall the game is spectacular, 4/5.",

Once I started my first adventure, I could not put down the game for 2 hours, it was that intriguing. The graphics are very beautifully done and the storyline is very well thought through with solid characters. The fact that there are 100+ different routes definitely added the extra star, otherwise making it 4 of a way to short story. I love that Inkle can do multiplayer after you do pretty much all the story options (like I have) and It would be cool if Inkle could do updates to advance the story? THAT WOULD MAKE IT SOOO COOOLLLLLLLLLLL. And once you get bored of the story, to you gamers, I advise you create your own achievements for the game or try playing the character in different personalities. Great job Inkle, an astounding masterpiece.",

Berlin isn't where you want to go, but you go there for the totally different route and luckily figure out how to get there, doing this so you can get that huge shot of money necessary to help cross the ocean later.\n\nBut then pirates steal your suitcase.

But that’s not a detail that should be left up to me - how am I to know what a character looks like?  A good choose your own adventure story would provide me with the details, then give me the option of whether or not I want to approach this person, or how I want to approach them. \n\nThere also needs to be some real consequences to bad choices. I haven’t had a situation yet where I’ve been killed or significantly set back because of a wrong choice. I’ve literally just clicked random options, and still done rather well. \n\nThere’s a good idea here for sure, and the design and gameplay is beautifully done. The story line and options just needs to be improved",
