Those are just the 2 i see every day i play.",

This isnt major praise though.\n\nThe game is frankly best described as a lock down death spiral. Going first is incredibly powerful due to how creatures deal damage to each other. There can be the occasional game of back and forth but comebacks are almost impossible without drawing a very luck combo. \n\nLets also top it off with awful, did I say awful hero balance. Very few are viable and a few are even virtually unplayable. No, Im not kidding, you will almost never see a few and you will literally never see about two. These balance problems extend heavily into the cards that make up the battle decks of cards you draw from. \n\nAgain its fine for mobile time wasting but as an actual CCG its laughably bad compared to whats out there and if you spend money on it youre going to regret it. \n\nNot awful. Not great. But a great time waster? Yup!",

The cards are well thought out to avoid overpowering strategies, while remaining devastating in their combination. Getting a competitive deck together is blissfully easy for a free player, yet building a truly competitive deck takes skill. \n\nWulven however, could really use a better plan, and more support. There have been very few cards added to a relatively small card pool since I started about 4-5 years ago. The post-release changes to digital cards makes buying the physical cards seem like a shaky idea. There didn’t seem to be much thought about tournaments when designing the UI so (the last I knew) they were setting them up using private battle function, since there were only 3 ways to play, Campaign(AI), Battle (Random opponent), or private battle (password to enter). This seemed like a very sloppy way to organize a tournament, and it would be much nicer to see it integrated into the UI, so players can enter and play tournaments through the menu. All that aside I still give it five stars, because it is a game that focuses on fairness and fun over being an overly flashy cash-grab, and that’s rare but it shows integrity. I’ve made several crystal purchases just to support Wulven for a job well done.",

There is a solo game play that can be challenging and will make you use your brain to build a deck to beat it (three star solo missions). PVP is very balanced with lots of players. Also a meltdown version that lets you play cross class cards you don’t own which is a way to discover new stuff. All cards are available in the store so while it will take you a bit of time to build up you might find yourself playing in years and I believe there is a dual pvp version in development. Genuinely a great game. Only negative is that if you want more from the community and guilds you have to use Messenger app to log into the approved chat rooms as the game a single world chat room.

It doesn’t make sense that the opponent would start out with monsters on the field. There is almost no way to get over that disadvantage. Also these in app purchases are stupid. I understand why it was done, but it makes it impossible or way to time consuming to build up coins and crystals to build the deck you want. This game was way better before these changes.",
