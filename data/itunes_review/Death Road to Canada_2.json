The first suggestion would be a minor change to the bow. The piercing chance should be buffed, while the non- charged bow shot should be slightly weaker, to balance it. The second suggestion would be to have online multiplayer between friends on steam, game center, etc. The third suggestion would be to have fitness or strength increase a point every 200 zombies destroyed. The fourth would be to buff martial arts to deal slightly more knock-back and have more range. The fifth would be a new trait that resembles a careless, loyal and innocent character. The upsides would be something along the lines of having good attitude and loyalty. The downsides would be wits, strength, and fitness. This trait would either be similar to oblivious or it would replace it. This is all up to you, of course. I know this game doesn’t update anymore, but if you do see this, please don’t feel compelled to make these changes. These are just things that I feel would improve the game.",

I’ve even tried offloading the app, but it doesn’t work. The only way I can progress is by not looting, but this will slowly kill me.

There are simply too many zombies for this game to load at these higher stages of endless, with impossible being a usual quantity and completely solid not being so rare. Still, Please Fix this!",

Like having Hard difficulty with familiar characters, rare or super rare characters applied so you can have a challenge with on a unpredictable road trip to Canada. Maybe hard mode with the shorter trip or longer trip mode on with that to change things up a bit! These are just small things I’d like to see.

Kind of annoying and I have to be paranoid that someone’s suddenly going to drop something really good for something mediocre.\n\nThat’s it really.\n\nAside from that, a Master Piece of a game.",

This review isn't to turn potential buyers away, because I strongly recommend this game to anyone that favors retro games or liked Oregon Trail. It has very unique graphics that are not common in this day and age, amazing replayability, and quirky, charming humor that's very lovable. I've finished most of the game modes and I've been cycling through Endless mode for a while; however, I have ironically played the game TOO much that I'm on day 251 and I can't finish any ABL's without the game crashing as soon as I tap \"yes\" to leave the location. I don't know if it's because there's too many zombies for my phone to handle or what, but if you can, please fix this. I'm not sure if this is useful, but I'm on an iPhone 6s+, 64GB with 38GB remaining, iOS 12.1.2.",

This goofy, creative, and brutally difficult zombie-themed road trip simulator has been, and will probably continue to be, my go-to time killer. Despite my 313 playthroughs (7 wins, 306 losses), the random generation of each encounter keeps things fresh, and the frequent updates continue to add new content. This game has truly infinite replay value. It is easily the best game on iOS, and better than most console games to boot. At $8, DR2C is worth every penny. See you in Canada.",

Ok so when an unfavorable put come happens i.e someone dying you force close the app. This just takes some challenge from the game. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think it happens because of how the game saves, it doesn’t save when exploring so, if you rest the game mid scavenge run it won’t actually keep the out come.

I love the idea, but could you please add a joystick or something to make movement easier? It’s ridiculous how annoying and slippery the current way to move is, and I’ve died multiple times just from running out of screen room to slide my thumb on. I also think making a seperate button just for attacking would be good, although I don’t as much about that as the movement thing.",

Welp, I saw: since opening the app, it has been ALL I’ve done at work ( calling on computers.. we’re encouraged to be on our phones playing with apps, for a few reasons) , and it has also made time zip by, which is semi-precious for an app to keep me entertained that much. Furthermore, I haven’t even made it past the first round of massive hoarding, there’s already soooo much replay value for me, I can keep on going- I don’t tire after a few times of being beat down by the crowds.  For what your money is worth, I’m going to say that this game is worth the 14 bucks. It’s like 14 dollars worth of paid games wrapped into one, it’s totally worth it.
