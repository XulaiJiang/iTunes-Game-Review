Thats not the games fault (as 90% have not had this issue) it is a problem with your phone. Ive seen one where they gave it a 2 star because they got a headache. Yes i did not mis-type, a headache made this person give it a 2 star. Im confused when people say they deleted the game because they died at the 5th stage and they had to restart, the stages take literally 3 seconds so it would take 15 seconds to get back to stage 5 :/ Each level contains 5 stages. Its not a bad game, its all opinion based, I personally enjoy games like these(quick reaction times, planning on where to jump and when), hence the 5 star, but i understand if its not some peoples cup of tea.",

Some are as short as 2 seconds and the dragging is so sluggish, it just FEELS like a slow game. But the absolute worst part about this game? Every time you jump from platform to platform, the camera zooms in for absolutely no reason, making it EXTREMELY difficult to time all your moves correctly. If the camera wasn't so hyper, I would probably still be playing the game. But it's so sluggish and inaccurate with the dragging of the character, it's not worth the 82 MB in your phone",
