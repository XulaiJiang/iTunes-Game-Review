They need to create these lit areas around the entire island to allow disembarking at will.  To make islands much larger for treasure hunting and more in depth quests.\n\n- add random encounters at sea whether you’re ready or not, make it challenging - add the fear aspect.\n\n- add the ability to disembark at towns and cities where you can recruit your crew based on personality and stats.\n\n- I could keep on with the suggestions, so kudos to the team who developed this game.

I’m out at sea when I receive the day three or four rewards and this over fills my boat. Now I can barely move. I have tried to be patient and just float to port but it’s been hours and barely noticeable progress. Since I haven’t paid, I cannot capture another ship. My only hope is to dump nearly half my loot. So I figured since I have to lose everything anyway I’ll just start over. This just reset all of my XP but it restarts with me away from port and with most of my earned loot. Now I am still overweight and cannot move. All of my progress is lost. My only hope is to throw away all 3 or 4 day’s worth of rewards. So frustrating. I don’t think I’ll be playing again.",

Even on the free version it’s enough to keep you entertained for a good while.\n So far my only issue has been weird spawning when you enter a battle, sometimes they drop me directly on a bomb or right next to an island that damages the hull. But a pretty minor thing in the long run. Also there should be away to cancel missions you accepted. l wish to buy the full version when I can, it seems worth it",

Just one thing i’d change, i do not spend money on add-ons and this game to get any fun progress you must buy add ons, specifically ships, i wish that you could have new ships without buying an add on. This would be so great, if you made a really crazy mission to earn a nerfed bark or something that is available for everyone even without add ons, this would be very fun! Or have an expensive bark or something at only one island! Again this game is great everything is perfect exept for the fact that if you dont get add ons you are stuck on a, well boring xebec. Its not nesasarily boring, ive just been playing for days worth of time and i want to spice up the game! Keep up the good work!!!! You guys are very good at what you do!!! - VERY SATUSFIED\n\nUpdate on my review!!! : the devs are AMAZING they are on top of thier game and dont leave any user in the dust!!! This app and the devs are perfect! Thank you devs and keep up the AMAZING work!!!!! \n❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️\n\nUpdate on my review- Everyone who wants to get this game should definitely get it they are pretty amazing people, they helped with the ship issue in a matter of a week! THANK YOU!!!!🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍\n\n- a satisfied customer",

Just a one thing (the only reason it got 4 stars), I really think that there should be more fun things to do, like more legendary ships like the Grim Reaper, that was so fun and having the chance to capture it and keep it. I think more things like this would be great. Stuff like legendary ship missions or even ships available for purchase, like the Flying Dutchman or the Queen Anne’s Revenge or something of that nature. I would definitely pay for that. To add on to that would just be more ship suggestions for other ships, all the ships are pretty plain and there aren’t a lot of options that make your ship unique. Anyways, that’s really all I have! Such a great game though, definitely worth downloading, looking forward to what’s next!!",

Which players will try the game and see they not getting the full on experience they have to pay $7.99 for it. Makes no sense your loseing money. (Free Advice by the way). Runescape has that same issue thats why everyone is playing the old crappy version which is free rather then paying monthly to play the game. Same concept. Other then that its awesome game but you messing us with chargeing for full version.",

If you want to play all of the quest, you have to buy the full version. If you want to go to other maps, you have to buy the full version(I tried sailing off the edge of the map, and they send sea monsters that kill you!! No way to get away from them) if you want to buy new ships with coins, you have to buy the full version. So until they stop trying to make you buy EVERYTHING, I’m done playing this game!!",
