The most annoying glitch is that it will notify you when it’s your turn, but then when you play, the notification stays. To get rid of the notification you have exit the game and then go back in. Given there’s a time limit on the game, knowing when it’s your turn is kind of important...\n\nStill worth the money and it’s fun to play with the bots, just please PLEASE prioritize the fix for this bug.",

It is appalling that out of five game avatar choices there is only one (white) woman and the rest are white men.  In this day and age, seriously?!  You couldn't do better?  I will not be spending money to buy any of the boards while the company shows a complete disregard for representation.  I get that you are setting this during a particular time period, but there were people of multiple races and both sexes traveling by train during that time period.  I have daughters, they should be able to chose from a selection of female avatars, and there absolutely should be options for POC.\n\nSecond, I tried the solo option, but I am not at all interested in a game of cutthroat.  The bots are programmed to deliberately block players from achieving their goals.  The bot I was playing had two of the three possible routes to Los Angeles.  As soon as I turned to take the middle route, which required two track placements, the bot took the other.  It had all three routes, and the third route it placed led nowhere, since I had already placed my track in the other half.  Nope!  I am not interested in playing a game of deliberately inhibiting other players.  You need an option for cutthroat or simple strategizing.  I have children, and I buy mostly co-operative games because I am trying to teach my children that winning is not about destroying others but is about working towards your goals.  I know there are people who enjoy cutthroat, but make an option for those who do not.\n\nA number of people had recommended this game to me.  I thought it would be a fun addition to our game library, but not as it is.",

It happens 2 out of 3 times I restart before a game is complete.  Less if I complete a game but still often.  And it’ll crash on restart multiple times sometimes.  I’ve had it crash 5-6 times before finally starting.  I stopped playing for several months but recently started again and hoped the bug was fixed but it’s worse now.  Please look into this.\n\nAlso, for those of us who play solo and like to start over if we don’t like our starting route options can you make a faster way to restart the game without have to go back and reselect all game options.  This might be “cheating” but I’ve played many hundreds of times and for some of us playing solo, sometimes the game isn’t worth playing if you don’t get the right challenge to start.  I wouldn’t give the game 5 stars without the option for a quicker restart. It’s a small but annoying thing.  Please fix the crashing bug first though.  That makes it exponentially worse..",

But yesterday when I tried to shift to one of the maps I had purchased, it told me to buy it.  “Restore purchases” , rebooting the game, rebooting my iPad, deleting and reloading the game ....nothing works.  The help section says that when you ask to reload purchases the game will ask for Apple ID, but it doesn’t.  I sent a complaint to Asmodee, and while they acknowledged receipt, there has been no other response.  I see in the chat section that others are have had the same problem.  I will change my rating when this is corrected.\nEdit:\n\nThe developer fixed the bug that caused me to lose my maps, so I’m changing my rating to 4 stars. It’s a great game, and you can play it online, a huge advantage in this pandemic.",

I have not found a way to contact support and file my issues either. It freezes often, last night I was kicked out of 4 games that I had played almost until the end due to freezing issues. Often you have to reload the game after the game players all enter so the bot ends of choosing your routes. I came here thinking there must be an update, but there is not. If the game would run smoothly and have its issues fixed it would be 5 stars. Right now I am just frustrated I spent money for a game that doesn’t work.",

Also to computer knows the routes I need and continues to randomly block my only path making me waste trains & moves I know it’s doing it because at the end you can see opponents targets. The tracks blocking me have NOTHING to do w/ computer’s routes. Also, it always has the right amount of trains/right colors to always end up without leaving any unused trains. EVERY TIME!  REALLY?!? Would give it 4 or 5 stars if it didn’t have the annoying GLITCH. I have restart my phone when it starts because it gets WORSE as time passes.",

Local Games are the worst, though. Playing one is like walking into a field of land mines—you never know when or why the app will crash.\n\nBeyond all the crashing: If one player leaves the app during play, even for a second, the app has trouble noticing when they return to the game. When that happens, you wait and wait. You leave again. Come back. Close the app entirely. Come back. Did that kill your game? Maybe. Maybe not. Should you “Please wait” another ten minutes or roll the dice on your evening?\n\nWhen it actually does register that both players are present again, it forgets whose turn it was and locks up indefinitely for one player.\n\n(We’re playing with two up-to-date iPhone 11’s over the same Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.)\n\nIf these bugs had been fixed within the last few years and/or it were easy to submit bugs, this would be a five-star review. The gameplay is fun and the expansions are great. For that reason, I can’t give it one star. I really want it to be as fun as it could be.\n\nHowever, the Local Game bugs so consistently crush our fun—and it’s so convoluted to figure out where to go for support—that we’re fixing to check out for good.\n\nWill I miss it? Yeah. But our tabletop version is waiting with open arms.",
