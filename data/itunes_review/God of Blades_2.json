                    "label": "Very impressed to encounter a mobile game similar in gameplay mechanics and ambience to that of Dark Souls. It is unclear what the storyline and purpose of the player’s journey in the game is supposed to be but there is a lot of potential here. This game is bound to cost money if it lives up to the quality in its lite version. \nThe graphics are stunning, very pleasantly detailed and generally realistic in nearly every aspect. I would even consider recommending it based on visuals alone— absolutely outstanding in the realm of mobile games. My only suggestion for the visuals is regarding the realism of the blood. The blood’s red color is too bright and the way it is released from the monsters with each hack does not match the realism presented with the rest of the game’s artistic aspects. \nThere are a lot of creative proponents too. In this game, once a monster reaches certain points in their health bar, you are presented with a sort of scene featuring the player making attacks not possible with the moves provided, giving you a visual break to just watch your player make some super cool attacks. It is unlike any other game I’ve encountered in this respect, and it offers unique and refreshing perspectives to online battling. This is just one piece of evidence for the game’s creativity but it seems to be a good indicator that considerable thought is being placed into making it a high quality game that goes beyond what its influencers have done before.\nI can’t find much to complain about, but I have some more small suggestions. Having a zoom in/ out option would be nice, especially when not battling. Planting objects and trinkets to find around the map would add depth to the game and storyline too. If finding and interacting with objects becomes a part of the game, it would be better to have the player have complete freedom when traversing the terrain (so he is able to run through grass and not be hindered from running off a road for example). It’s awkward but understandable that there’s a restriction to where the player can go and interact with in the lite version though. An option to not have the screen always locked on the player would be nice too. \n\nI’m glad I encountered Blade of God, and I look forward to when the full version is released on the App Store!",

Also, the entire game reads like it’s translated from Somali to English. Very unprofessional in a literary standpoint. I understand that it’s just a demo, but it’s such an underwhelming experience.",

I especially love the critical attacks and kill scenes; shocking in the best way and  are quite exciting. There are, of course, the obvious things that can be improved, but I’ve no doubt the developers will create an excellent game. I honestly believe this has the potential to surpass the famous games like DH5. I see so much potential and I cannot wait for the full version to come out.",

The game bosses had really cool and surprising entries and during the boss fight, I like how the battles progressed as the boss got weaker. One thing that I don’t see a lot of in games like these are female bosses. Those would be a cool addition to the game. Overall, I really loved your game. \n\nSuggestions:\nAdvance the parkour \nAdd some story( just a little bit not too much)\nTry to add gashes when you have those killy little brutal boss cutscenes.\nMaybe when the character throws an enemy, the enemy can collide with another enemy. Killing 2 birds with 1 stone. \nThank you so much and please finish the game!",
